      "title": "Machinery Focus: Consistent tractor sales bring guarded optimism",
      "text": "More than half the tractors sold each year are registered in the first six months, so now that the June figures are in for 2023 we have a fair handle of how total tractor sales for the year are likely to pan out, and the story is of sales consistent with previous years. In Ireland it appears that sales are returning to normal after the disruption of the past few years with 1,438 tractors sold this year, although this new normal compares very favourably with 2019 when 1,361 were registered up until June. Mixed sentiments Looking back over the previous three years the impression given is that, despite all the talk of component shortages limiting production, sales were not hit as hard as many feared. The number of tractors sold in the most affected year, 2022, showed only a 9% shortfall from the average. This did not, however, refrain manufacturers from increasing prices, noting that such increases were due to their inability to produce machines courtesy of supply chain issues and spiralling costs. Neither did it stop farmers buying the machines at these inflated prices with most trade estimates suggesting that the cost of buying a new tractor has risen around 25% over the past couple of years. High commodity prices helped cushion the shock with milk prices in the region of 65c/L, but now that has dropped back and grain shortages with higher prices peaked last October, although the recent collapse of the Ukrainian grain deal has pushed them up again. Steady as she goes The trend in Ireland has been for sales to remain relatively stable over the year. January registrations were higher than the previous two years which has been attributed to customers delaying the collection of their machines until the new year. Yet this is not a situation that is shared throughout Europe. Italy has recorded a mixed bag of results for this year so far, with new tractor sales declining and used tractor sales showing a significant increase over the last year, along with combines and material handlers. This switch to older tractors has alarmed the trade as it maintains that the adoption of the latest technology is delayed, which will cause a loss of efficiency within Italian agriculture. CEMA’s latest report noting that manufacturers’ stocks are now at an all-time high suggests that IT may have been rather too optimistic in ITS sales forecasts, and that IT could live to regret not trying harder to constrain prices in a market where demand temporarily outstripped supply. Tractor sales in the US The US has also been sending mixed signals with an overall decline in tractors sales so far this year of 9.7%, with the sharpest decline being in the sub 40hp segment which saw a loss of 13% compared to this time last year. The two bright spots however, were the >100hp segment which went up 9.4%, while the switch to four-wheel drive gained further momentum with an impressive 45.5% increase, although the number sold is still a fraction of total tractor sales, just 1.4%. Here in the west it appears that tractor sales have not been damaged to any great extent over the last few years despite the consistent talk of scarcities and supply chain shortages. No one is denying that there haven’t been supply problems, especially with electronic components, and it is telling that the manufacturers of more basic tractors say they were able to supply machines from stock throughout the last three years whereas more complex tractors were often delayed. The west, though, is just one part of a much larger global market and other parts of the world are showing much healthier sales; India is up 8% and Brazil 23%, but to a certain extent these figures represent the adoption of the tractor rather than ongoing renewal of an established fleet. Reducing the gamble Back here in Ireland the trade is undecided as to what 2024 will bring. All dealers agree that there is unlikely to be any great collapse in the market, but as to the extent to which it may shrink, or even grow, there is no consensus whatsoever. It is pointed out that with the majority of machinery being bought on finance of one sort or another, costs are becoming far more predictable and consistent, which means buying new is not the lottery it once was when it came to borrowing costs. One dealer Agriland spoke to also made the interesting observation that, thanks to mobile banking apps, farmers are always aware of their financial position and, as a consequence, are far more relaxed about planning their spending, knowing that their outgoings will also be consistent. Recent rises in interest rates have not worried the trade too much. Exhibitors at the Farm Tractor and Machinery Trade Association (FTMTA) show all said that the subject hardly arose in discussing machinery purchases with their customers, and at 4% it is hardly excessive when compared with the rates that many farmers will have experienced in the not too distant past. Altogether it appears that the machinery trade will continue much as before, there will of course be ups and downs but the sentiment in the trade is these will not be as dramatic as might have been otherwise expected.",

She later uploaded a video of the incident in her Instagram stories. Uorfi Javed Faces Sexual Harassment on Flight by Group of Drunk Men, Shares Video Actor Uorfi Javed is known for her bold way of living. She dresses up in the most unusually designer outfits and she owns every bit of it. But, for a section of people, all her unabashedness seems like a license to troll her, to criticise her, or worst, to slut shame her. Something similar happened to her while she was on her way to Goa. Uorfi shared a video in her Instagram stories and wrote about how a group of young men started harassing her sexually on the flight. She narrated her ordeal in a note as the video showed a few young, drunk men sitting behind her seat. Uorfi said the man called her names, molested her on the flight, and passed harsh comments. Her note read, “While travelling from Mumbai to Goa on one of the flights yesterday I had to go through harassment, the men in this video were saying nasty things, Eve teasing and calling names. When I confronted them one of them said that their friends were drunk. Being drunk is no excuse to misbehave with women. Public figure YES, Public property NO (sic).” Uorfi Javed shares a video of men harassing her on the flight Uorfi has been vocal about all the harassment she faces almost on a daily bases for being the way she is. The actor has earlier talked about her abusive childhood and how she was raised by a conservative father. She has explained how she never cares about people commenting on her fashion sense because that’s her way to express herself and stay unapologetic. Misbehaving with a woman only because she doesn’t conform to your idea of morality is one of the sickest social problems. Uorfi seems to be fighting this battle every day. More power to her!

      "title": "Delhi: Waqf Board responds as Indian Railways issued notices to demolish centuries-old mosques",
      "text": "There was unrest in the Aurangabad district of Bihar after beef was found in the premises of a nearby Hanuman Temple. To stop any communal unrest, police were stationed in the neighbourhood. On Saturday, locals in Balabigha, Haspura, discovered meat kept within the Hanuman Temple. The police and the relevant authorities were then contacted. As soon as police arrived, the temple was washed and sanitised. The meat was allegedly kept within the shrine by some antisocial characters in an effort to sabotage local peace. In a discussion with the people, the police also made the decision to look over the CCTV footage from the area to spot anti-social individuals and punish them severely. The conversation promoted rapprochement between the populace. Police were stationed in the neighbourhood, nevertheless, as a precaution to stop any racial unrest. A similar incident also happened near the Hanuman temple at the T-intersection in Katcha Katra, where a sack of beef was found. The Hindu side protested and blocked the route after getting information about this. They demanded that a case be filed and that the suspect be taken into custody right now. At the T-junction, the police are always present. Despite this, unidentified miscreants threw the beef. Residents are shocked at the police’s carelessness. Such atrocities will not be permitted, a Hindu organisation representative Rajesh Awasthi stated. Another similar incident occurred in Faridabad where police arrested two accused, out of the two one is a butcher. They are arrested for reportedly tossing the head and meat of at least four buffaloes close to a Hanuman temple on Gurugram-Faridabad Road. According to the police, they are looking for two further suspects who got away. Police say that on Friday at 9 a.m., someone visiting the temple saw some meat close to the stairwell and contacted temple officials, who then called the police. Senior police officers, a crime squad, and a forensic science laboratory (FSL) team visited the scene and gathered samples after the police control centre was alerted.",

      "text": "Gambia’s government is “far advanced” in exploring avenues for potential legal action against Indian drugmaker Maiden Pharmaceuticals and a local distributor over toxic cough syrups believed to have killed dozens of children, it said on Friday. At least 70 children in Gambia, most under 5 years old, died from acute kidney injury last year. A government task force which investigated the deaths found they were “a direct result” of contaminated cough and cold syrups imported from India. Gambia has fired the executive director and deputy director of its Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and referred the matter to police after the task force found that the medicines in question were not registered with the MCA, which is required by law, the government said in a statement. The small West African country has hired a US law firm to explore legal action, the justice minister previously told Reuters. The Indian drugmaker Maiden Pharmaceuticals has denied wrongdoing, and the Indian government says that tests it conducted on the drugs showed they were not contaminated. Atlantic Pharmaceuticals, a local distributor of the drugs, could not be reached. Families of 20 of the children have already sued the two companies as well as Gambian authorities. “The government is currently benefiting from legal advice from a top tier international law firm,” Gambia’s government said in the statement, adding it is also pursuing potential redress through engagement with the Government of India.",

      "title": "'Manipur Files should be made': Shiv Sena slams BJP over ethnic violence",
      "text": "Slamming the BJP governments at the Centre as well as in Manipur over the ethnic violence in the state, the Shiv Sena (UBT) on Saturday said a movie titled 'Manipur Files' should be made. Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh, an editorial in Sena (UBT) organ ‘Saamana' said the violence and atrocities in the north-eastern state are worse than in Kashmir. A video shot on May 4 surfaced on Wednesday, showing two women from one of the warring communities in Manipur being paraded naked by a few men from the other side, sparking national outrage. The party said that had the Supreme Court not taken cognisance of the matter, the prime minister would have not spoken about the issue. Modi on Thursday said the incident of disrobed women being paraded in Manipur has shamed 140 crore Indians, asserting that the law will act with its full might and no guilty will be spared. In recent times, Saamana said, movies like the ‘Tashkent Files', ‘The Kerala Story', and ‘The Kashmir Files' have been made. “The same people should now make a movie named ‘Manipur Files' on the violence in the state,” it said. The party said had there been a non-BJP government in the state, it would have been dismissed by now. It alleged that Manipur is politically insignificant for the PM and this is the reason behind the situation in the state is being ignored. The party said 60,000 central paramilitary forces have been stationed in Manipur and yet there is no let-up in the violence. “This means the situation has gone out of control of the PM and the (Union) Home minister,” the editorial added.",

Ravindra Jadeja’s controversial DRS decision. (Pic: Twitter) New Delhi: A bizarre incident took place on the Day 2 of the second Test match between India and West Indies in Port Of Spain, Trinidad on Friday when a wrong replay was displayed after the West Indies took the DRS against Ravindra Jadeja. Luckily, the right decision was made despite the glitch. The incident happened when India was at 360/5 in the 104th over Jadeja attempted to drive a wide ball outside the off stump off pacer Kemar Roach. The ball went to wicketkeeper Joshua Da Silva, who started celebrating as he was sure the Indian batter had nicked the delivery. But the all-rounder was unmoved as on-field umpire Marais Erasmus did not raise his finger. Then, West Indies captain Kraigg Braithwaite, after discussing with players, took the DRS to challenge the on-field decision. However, the replay played by the TV umpire was different from the delivery for which the review was taken. In the replay, third umpire (Michael Gough) saw, Jadeja’s bat was close to his pads. However, in the actual delivery, he was playing away from his body and there was a clear gap between the bat and pad. DRS scam 2023.

The platform said the changes will take effect on Friday and will affect users who don’t have a verified badge or a Twitter Blue subscription. The company did not reveal what the exact DM limit will be but suggested that users who want to send unlimited DMs will have to sign up for Twitter Blue, its paid service that costs Rs 900 per month in India and offers various features and perks. This is the latest move by Twitter owner Elon Musk, who acquired the platform in 2022 after a fierce bidding war, to tackle the spam and bot problem that has plagued Twitter for years, among other things. Musk has famously declared that he will “defeat the spam bots or die trying!” Last week, Twitter introduced a new DM setting where messages from users who you follow will arrive in your primary inbox, and messages from verified users who you don’t follow will be sent to your message request inbox. And earlier, the company introduced rate limits - temporary restrictions on the number of tweets users can view every day. This was announced following what looked like an outage that affected users across the globe. Twitter said the new DM limits and settings are meant to “reduce spam in Direct Messages” but people are already accusing the company of using DMs as a way to force users to pay for Twitter Blue.",

      "title": "He’s serving a 300-year sentence for 5 killings in Gary, Indiana, another man later confessed to",
      "text": "On a winter morning in 2000, police tape surrounded two bloody crime scenes in one of Gary’s toughest neighborhoods. The bullet-riddled, partially clothed bodies of two women were found in a baseball park. In a white, frame house not far away, a man and two women, also shot, were dead on the living-room floor. Cleveland “Christopher” Bynum told police his night started with drinking beer and playing pool at a VFW hall and ended with killing three of the five victims. He later recanted, saying Gary detectives coerced his confession. But he was convicted of all five murders and got a 300-year prison term — 60 years for each victim. For 23 years, his lawyers have pursued his claim of innocence but lost appeals. Now, they say they’ve amassed a “mountain of evidence” he wasn’t the killer and hope to persuade the courts of that. “If he went to trial today, he’d be acquitted so fast,” says Nicky Ali Jackson, executive director of Purdue University Northwest’s Center for Justice and Post-Exoneration Assistance in Hammond. Bernard Carter, the Lake County, Indiana, prosecutor, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Bynum, 44, was convicted of killing Elizabeth Dailey Ayres, 37, of Portage, Indiana, and Sheila Renee Bartee, 37, Anthony Jeffers, 36, Angela Wallace, 24, and her sister Susan Wallace, 34, all of Gary. The killings occurred on Feb. 17, 2000. Jeffers and the Wallace sisters were shot in a home in Gary’s faded Aetna neighborhood. Angela Wallace’s 12-year-old son and her sister’s 18-month-old daughter were unharmed. The same day, the bodies of Dailey Ayres and Bartee were found in a park. Bynum says Gary detectives coerced his confession by refusing to let him make a call, denying him a lawyer and threatening to arrest his fiancée and put his child in state custody. He says the police wouldn’t give him food or water or let him use the restroom. No forensic evidence linked Bynum to the crimes — no gun or fingerprints or DNA evidence. The only direct evidence against Bynum was a statement by Larry Brooks, Angela Wallace’s 12-year-old son. Detectives said the boy told them he was awakened by five bangs and heard a man he knew as Chris tell someone “put another shell in” and “shoot her in the head.” He said he couldn’t remember Chris’ last name but said it started with a “B.” But, in 2020, Larry Brooks, now in his 30s, met with one of Bynum’s attorneys and a Lake County prosecutor and in a deposition told them: “I don’t remember saying half this s---.” Brooks also said a Gary cop told him — before he met with detectives the morning of the killings — Chris Bynum had confessed. Which wasn’t possible because Bynum wasn’t arrested until the next day. Brooks’ deposition is among evidence Bynum’s lawyers cite as examples of a bungled investigation that got the wrong guy. Other evidence of Bynum’s innocence, they say, includes: Another confession: Gerald Mathews, who also went by Chris, said in a video recording that he was the killer. “My understanding is that an innocent man is doing the time that I was supposed to,” Mathews said. He was fatally shot in 2014 but had arranged for his recording to be turned over to authorities after his death. Indiana courts have found Mathews’ confession wasn’t credible because releasing it only after his death ensured he didn’t face any consequences. Two DNA hits: Tests in 2017 excluded Bynum from DNA recovered from the victims but showed a link to a late Gary police officer’s son. The tests also showed a link between one of the victims and an unidentified person whose DNA profile was recovered from the door of a 2010 murder scene in nearby Lake Station, Indiana.Questions over trial defense: In 2009, the federal appeals court in Chicago ruled that Bynum’s trial lawyer provided ineffective assistance because he failed to put Bynum on the witness stand to testify his confession was coerced. The court calledd the evidence against Bynum “skimpy.” But it upheld his conviction, saying it was unlikely Bynum’s confession would have been thrown out even if he’d tesified.Questions about witnesses: They include a woman who said Rob Carr and another man showed up at her home covered in blood and that Carr burned his clothes in a barbecue and said he was with the other man, who killed all five people. Carr later died in a car accident.Detective accused of misconduct: A murder charge was dropped in 2002 against a woman who stabbed her husband to death. She said in a lawsuit that Gary detectives — including one who interrogated Bynum — ignored evidence supporting her self-defense claim. The city of Gary settled the lawsuit. At the heart of the case against Bynum were the statements he gave police. In the first, Bynum told them, “I didn’t have nothing to do with it.” He admitted he was at the house when the three victims were shot but gave detectives the name of a man he said was responsible for the killings. Later, that man and another man killed the women in the park, Bynum said. Bynum’s lawyers say he was removed from his holding cell and confronted by one of those men — a “known killer in the community” and a “hit man.” The lawyers say Bynum changed his story to protect himself. In his second statement, Bynum told detectives he played pool and drank beer at a VFW hall with one of the two men he named in the first interrogation. He said that, afterward, he was in a car with that man when they spotted Jeffers — one of the murder victims — outside his home. Bynum said he got into an argument with Jeffers because he heard Jeffers was telling people he was a drug dealer. Later, he said, Jeffers drove up to Bynum in a car with two women — Dailey Ayres and Bartee. Bynum handed Jeffers a gun, and they all drove to the ballfield, where Jeffers shot the women, according to the statement. Bynum said he and Jeffers went to Jeffers’ house and got into a “tussle” because Bynum said he wouldn’t take the blame for the killings. Bynum said he thought Jeffers was trying to take his gun, which went off and killed Jeffers. Angela Wallace and her sister Susan started to approach him, he said, and he panicked, shooting them. Jackson, a criminal justice professor at Purdue University Northwest, says there’s good reason Bynum’s contradictory stories are hard to follow: He made them up. “This case was as sloppy as it gets,” Jackson says. The police didn’t check phone records, look for surveillance videos or test DNA evidence recovered from the women in the park, she says. Michael Ausbrook, a lawyer who runs an Indiana University center specializing in post-conviction appeals, says “there are things we are still pursuing before we take that last shot” — asking the appeals court in Chicago for a full review of the evidence, hoping to win a new trial. “Just with the DNA evidence and the Mathews confession, I don’t think there’s any chance he would be convicted,” Ausbrook says.",

      "text": "From IBC To Akashvani; History Of All India Radio On National Broadcasting Day By:FPJ Web Desk | July 22, 2023 On July 23 Sunday, India celebrates the National Broadcasting Day to mark the inception of India's first-ever radio broadcast. Here is a brief history of Radio broadcasting in India. Prasar Bharati Radio broadcasting services were introduced in India during British rule in 1923 as an initiative of the Radio Club of Bombay. India’s first-ever radio broadcast commenced from Bombay Station under the Indian Broadcasting Company in 1927. Pexels On July 23, 1927, All India Radio was founded as a private company called “Indian Broadcasting Company Ltd (IBC),” and this date became the basis for celebrating National Broadcasting Day, established in 1936. Pixabay Later, on June 8, 1936, IBC was transformed into All India Radio (AIR). In 1956, the name “Akashvani” was officially adopted for AIR, inspired by Rabindranath Tagore’s 1938 poem titled “Akashvani,” which translates to “voice or announcement from the skies.” Pixabay Radio broadcasting in India commenced as private initiatives in 1923 and 1924, with the establishment of radio clubs in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras (now Chennai). However, due to financial constraints, these stations had to shut down. Wikimedia commons Subsequently, a Broadcasting Service was introduced on an experimental basis in July 1927 in Bombay and a month later in Calcutta, through an agreement between the Government of India and a private company called the Indian Broadcasting Company Ltd. Pexels In response to public outcry over the closure of the Indian Broadcasting Company, the Government took charge of broadcasting on April 1, 1930, renaming it the Indian State Broadcasting Service (ISBS). Initially experimental, it became permanently under government control in 1932. Pexels A new radio station was established in Delhi in 1936. On June 8 of the same year, the Indian Broadcasting Service was rebranded as All India Radio (AIR), with a fresh signature tune. The Delhi station eventually grew into the core of national-level broadcasting. Pexels Thanks For Reading!

      "title": "Greed for power overrode national interest under previous government: PM Modi",
      "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday that greed for power overrode national interest during the UPA government, wreaking havoc on the banking sector, but his dispensation has nursed it back to good financial health. Addressing a Rozgar Mela, PM Modi took an apparent swipe at the Gandhi family, saying a few powerful politicians close to a particular family would get loans of thousands of crores of rupees to their favourites by calling up banks and those loans were never meant to be returned. He said that the \"phone banking\" scam was one of the biggest scams of the previous government as it broke the back of the banking system. Phone banking may be a common practise now but its idea was different for the government which was there nine years ago as it was not meant for the common citizen, PM Modi said. He also said that India is now among the countries with the strongest banking sectors following a series of measures taken by his government. Addressing a gathering of recruits after giving appointment letters to over 70,000 of them virtually, PM Modi noted that a large number of them have been employed in the banking sector as he highlighted how it was \"destroyed\" under the previous Congress-led dispensation before his government took corrective measures. READ | 'Manipur Files should be made’: Shiv Sena slams BJP over ethnic violence The UPA was in power during 2004-14. His government, PM Modi asserted, took several measures, including strengthening the management of banks, merging small banks and injecting professionalism, to help the sector. Public sector banks were earlier known for losses running into thousands of crores of rupees and non-performing assets (NPAs), but now they are known for record profits, the prime minister said. He also praised banking sector employees for their hardwork and commitment to serve people and execute various government schemes to help the poor and unorganised sectors through loans under the 'Mudra' scheme and to support women self-help groups. PM Modi said India has emerged as a centre of global trust and attraction and added that the country has to make full use of it. Opportunities are increasing in various fields, he said. India is now counted among the countries with the strongest banking sector, he said, adding that it was not the case nine years back. \"There are many examples of the destruction which is caused when the greed for power overrides national interest. Our banking sector has suffered this destruction under the previous government,\" he told the young recruits. Loans given to favourites were never really repaid during those times and one loan was sanctioned after another to clear previous dues on paper, PM Modi said. By laws like the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, banks were protected from NPAs while tough action against those accused of swindling banks, including attachments of their properties, was also taken, he said. PM Modi said his government has also insured bank deposits up to Rs 5 lakh, ensuring the safety of more than 99 per cent of account holders.",

      "title": "Cooking Chapati on Tawa or Direct Flame: Which is Better",
      "text": "Fashion & Lifestyle Cooking Chapati on Tawa or Direct Flame: Which is Better admin July 22, 2023 0 3 min read Home Lifestyle Cooking Chapati on Tawa or Direct Flame: Which is Better? In Indian households, chapatis are often cooked directly on open flame. However, there can be a discussion on which is healthier, cooking rotis on direct flame or gas stove? Roasting Chapati on Tawa or Direct Flame: Which is Better? Roti or Chapati is a significant Indian bread eaten at literally every meal. Roti is made from wheat flour, water, and salt and is cooked on a hot griddle or tawa. Indian households usually prefer to roast rotis on direct flame using a thong. However, as per studies, this popular cooking tradition was quoted being unhealthy and leading to the risk of cancer. If you have never cooked directly on a gas stove’s flame, you might wonder if that’s possible. Well to know more about this, we have stated whether this fact is true and which cooking method one should opt for. Is Roasting Chapatis on Direct Flame Dangerous? Well, there is no significant scientific evidence to claim that cooking roti on a direct flame can cause cancer. Studies have shown that the levels of carcinogenic compounds produced during the cooking of roti are low and are not likely to pose a significant health risk. Based on the study, E-Times spoke to Dr Shyam Aggarwal, who is a senior consultant at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital about the correlation between high-temperature cooking and cancer. He said, “We cannot link direct flame cooking with cancer. Carcinogens like heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are responsible for altering the DNA of the human body. It is not easy to say if the DNA damage is resulting in cancer as the human body has a natural mechanism to repair itself and emit such cells. Cancer Genesis results from gene alterations in the cells. So, the chemicals that generate through high-temperature cooking, have the potential to damage the DNA. Also, if we correlate high-temperature cooking with cancer, then the person should have been consuming such foods for a long duration. Cancer doesn’t happen on a few intakes of carcinogens. If a person consumes such foods (high-temperature) regularly, only then the carcinogens enter the body. So, I would say that there is no epidemiological evidence that reflects upon this correlation between high-temperature cooking and cancer. In principle, if there is anything that’s causing DNA alteration, one should avoid that thing.” Which is Better, Cooking Roti on Tawa or Direct Flame? Also, Celebrity Nutritionist Shweta Shah shared her intake with E-Times on which method of cooking chapati is better. According to her ”Previously Roti and Chapati were cooked on a tawa by pressing with a cloth. This method was a little time consuming, but it ensured that chapati is cooked at all the ends. Fast forwarding to recent times, Chapatis are cooked directly on the flames. Now, even though this method saves time, but there are few cautions to this method. Sometimes, Roti is not evenly cooked, some parts may burn turning black. Other thing is, as it is directly cooked on the flame, it may attract all the particles stuck on the gas stove. The harmful gases may enter the roti and make it harmful to health.” She concluded by saying it’s better to cook rotis on old tawa rather directly on flame ”So, why risk it? switch to your good old tawa and take your sweet time making Chapatis.” Here’s Why You Should Cook Roti on Tawa: A tawa is a flat and round iron or heat-conductive material griddle. When heated, it properly distributes heat throughout the surface, ensuring that the roti is evenly cooked. Cooking on tawa retains nutrients, such as fibre, protein and carbhoydrates. Since the roti is not cooked at a high temperature, these nutrients are not altered. Cooking roti on a tawa uses little oil or ghee, making it a low-fat cooking technique. Because the tawa holds heat efficiently, the roti cooks quickly without sticking or burning. Don’t Miss Out on the Latest Updates.Subscribe to Our Newsletter Today!

      "title": "Khalistan all noise, say Sikhs in Canada, doesn’t represent &#8216;silent majority&#8217;",
      "text": "As two groups flocked to two parades on July 8, one pro-India and the other anti-, a gurdwara in Canada's Oakville, 40 km from the Greater Toronto Area neighbourhood of Brampton, was seeing a gathering of another kind. A congregation of Sikhs and Hindus had come together to pray for peace with the recital of the ‘Sukhmani Sahib’. Since November last year, the din caused by pro-Khalistan voices in Canada, amplified by social media, have drowned out such pacifist voices. Yet, members of the Indian diaspora and other prominent voices in Canada say the recent incidents – including two so-called referendums on Khalistan organised by the outlawed Sikhs For Justice and a float at a parade on July 4 that re-enacted the assassination of former PM Indira Gandhi, inviting the strictest condemnation from the Indian government – should be seen for what they are: noise. Earlier this year, India had lodged a protest with Canada, flagging actions of “separatist and extremist elements” against Indian diplomatic missions and consulates. “It has turned ugly,” agrees Inderjit Singh Bal, former president of the World Sikh Organisation (WSO), “but the noise does not represent the silent majority of the Sikhs here. As they say in Punjabi, jaddon dhol bajda hai te been di awaaz nahin sundi (when someone is beating the drum, no one can hear the sound of the wind instrument).” Despite an attempt by pro-Khalistan voices to stage a comeback, many point out that they represent little more than the fringe. Back home in Punjab, too, the Khalistan agenda has found little resonance. This was proved in the 2021 Punjab Assembly elections, in which separatist proxies managed only 2.5 per cent of the vote share in the state. More recently, the arrest of self-styled preacher and Khalistan protagonist Amritpal Singh at Moga in April evoked a bigger reaction abroad than at home. Gurpreet Singh, a broadcaster and talk show host at Spice Radio in Canada, says, “The ground reality is that not all Sikhs support Khalistan; it’s mostly all hype. Remember, Khalistan had no popular support in Punjab, even at the height of militancy, when the state saw police excesses.” Terry Milewski, a veteran CBC News journalist who authored Blood for Blood: Fifty Years of the Global Khalistan Project in 2021, says it’s important to remember that “you cannot use the word Sikhs and Khalistanis interchangeably, for an overwhelming majority of 98 per cent of Sikhs do not support this agenda\". A 'fringe' seeking relevance The demand for Khalistan is not alien to Canada. Old-timers recall how Surjan Singh Gill, a mild-mannered man born in Singapore and raised in India and England, first set up the office of the ‘Khalistan government-in-exile’ in Vancouver on January 26, 1982. Though he also printed blue Khalistani passports and colourful currency, he gained little fandom among the local Sikhs. Some of his activists carrying posters in support of Khalistan were beaten up during the Vaisakhi procession that April. They were allowed to join in only after they had thrown away their placards. But 1984 changed it all. Operation Bluestar, launched by the Indian Army to flush out militants from the Golden Temple, and the targeting of Sikhs in the riots that followed her assassination gave this movement an unprecedented fillip among the diaspora. The aftermath saw the formation of a number of outfits with secessionist ideologies, among them the International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF) and the Babbar Khalsa in Britain. The ISYF, banned in Canada in 2003, has openly called for an independent Sikh state free from \"Hindu imperialism\", while the Babbars orchestrated the June 1985 Air India bombing. A leader of the WSO, which was set up in July 1984 to represent Sikh interests on the world stage, said there are three kinds of Khalistani activists in the West, including Canada. “The first category is of those directly aggrieved by police excesses in Punjab in the 1980s; the second is of people who have made a business out of it, and the third are those propped up by agencies inimical to India.\" Ujjal Dosanjh, the first person of colour to become premier of British Columbia in February 2000, defines another category: a 'fringe' seeking relevance and attention. “Many of them are not well integrated into society, they are not highly educated, they cling to grievances, real or imagined, and take pride in fighting for this mythical homeland,” he says. Dosanjh, who has always been very open in his criticism of the Khalistanis, narrowly escaped a murderous attack in 1985. He says the Khalistan issue is \"overblown\" and shouldn’t be a sticking point in a “mature relationship” between India and Canada. Dave Singh Hayer, former MLA of Canada's Surrey Tynehead and president of the Association of Former MLAs of British Columbia, says, \"Most of these individuals are motivated by business interests since they receive substantial funding, not only from local sources, but also from foreign countries like China and others.\" Among such protagonists is Ranjit Singh Khalsa, former ISYF president, who came to Canada as a refugee in 1988. He is now associated with Banda Singh Bahadur Gurdwara in Abbotsford, British Columbia, where he advocates for Khalistan. Khalsa's plea for citizenship was denied by a Canadian federal court in 2021. A judicial review of the decision by a member of the Immigration and Refugee Board found Khalsa to be inadmissible to Canada for having been an alleged member of the ISYF. Khalsa claimed that the concept of Khalistan was thrust upon the Sikhs due to the “actions” of the Indian government. 'Tacit patronage of Canadian politicians' The Khalistan movement in Canada hasn’t followed a linear path, rising and ebbing through the years, often reflecting the changing politics of India and its subcontinent. Gurpreet Singh, the talk show host, says that at one point, soon after the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government came to power, they thought it was in the past. Bhishma Agnihotri, then Ambassador-at-large, met some prominent Khalistanis and it appeared that reconciliation had begun. Amardeep Singh, the counsel for passport, visa and community affairs in Vancouver in 2014, says the Modi government too has made attempts at reconciliation. “At least 400 people in my jurisdiction in western Canada were taken off the blacklist. I met so many radicals and there were hardly any protests outside the (Indian) Consulate those days. We celebrated the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh and the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak across the globe, with the Indian government spending millions of dollars in just one year.\" The recent pro-Khalistan incidents began with the 'referendums' last November. Though most Canadian Sikhs agree that these are pure gimmickry, videos of people waving the \"Khalistan flag\" and SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannu leading the sloganeering went viral on social media and ignited a war of words in the virtual world. Former premier Dosanjh attributed the uptick in pro-Khalistan voices to the tacit patronage of Canadian politicians of Indian descent. In a recent interview, he said they had “infiltrated” local politics. In 2012, Jonathan Kay, managing editor for comment at the National Post, pointed out how Vancouver Sun's Kim Bolan reported about a militant minority of Sikhs \"vitiating\" British Columbia Vaisakhi parades by displaying images of Kanishka bomber Talwinder Singh Parmar, Indira Gandhi’s assassin Satwant Singh Bhaker and the killers of General AK Vaidya. “In many cases, naïve Canadian politicians, unable to read the Punjabi descriptions, have stood idly by, clapping their hands as images of these 'martyrs' rolled past,” wrote Kay. Kanwar Sandhu, a former MLA and veteran journalist who has covered the militancy in Punjab, rued that a certain section took unfair advantage of the liberal and democratic policies, and human rights charter of the Canadian government. Others, like Milewski, the veteran CBC News journalist, openly blamed vote-bank politics. Though comprising just 2 per cent of Canada’s population, Sikhs are concentrated in pockets and have a large number of lawmakers. The 2021 elections saw 17 Liberal MPs of Indian origin. Milewski says the Khalistan protagonists, a tiny minority within the diaspora, try to keep their political influence both with the Left and Right. Which is why politicians look the other way when they spew their extremist agenda, he says. Gurpreet Singh, whose wife Rachna Singh is a New Democratic Party (NDP) MLA and the Minister of Education and Child Care, lamented that the biggest fallout of the resurgence was the polarisation of Canadian Indians. “Now people identify themselves as Hindus and Sikhs,” he says. Another worry, though not a recent phenomenon, is the increasing influence of radicals on gurdwaras. In December 2018, 14 gurdwara management committees of Ontario met at Jot Parkash Gurdwara in Brampton used a local law against trespassing to impose a ban on the entry of Indian government representatives in gurdwaras under their control. The Gurdwara Sahib Dasmesh Darbar in Surrey has long been associated with hardliners, and openly displays huge posters of Parmar and other “martyrs”. The Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, once with moderates who often hoisted the Indian flag, was also taken over by radicals led by Nijjar, who once hosted Pakistani Consul General Janbaz Khan at the gurdwara. Gill says the “attempt to influence” youngsters, both in person and in the virtual world, is “most disturbing”. “Khalistani groups are luring new students from India with ‘welcome packages’, which include financial support for their education and weekly groceries. In return, they are expected to participate in protests,” he says. There is also an attempt to peddle an anti-India narrative through guest speakers at certain schools, he said, adding that the new generation is particularly vulnerable to propaganda as they have no memories or ties with India, other than mostly through their grandparents. Journalist Sandhu says it is a very complex issue that needs deft handling. “On the one hand, there are long-pending grievances from 1947 that need to be addressed. The people behind the movement seem very confused; it is just going on and on with no thought. What are the geographical boundaries of a separate state they seek? Is it physical or emotional? Is it in the interest of the Sikhs at all? Will they ever want to return? There are no clear answers. The movement only tends to alienate the protagonists from the mainstream,\" he says. The common Indo-Canadian Punjabi, emotionally bullied by separatists who often equate Khalistan with the reverence reserved for the Sikh faith, chooses to remain silent. But of late, some have begun to wonder if the actions of a few will fritter away the hard-won privileges of the early Punjabi settlers, who landed on Canadian shores in 1897, and battled racism and hostile weather to get equal rights and a home they could proudly call their own. Harji Bajwa, who migrated to Canada at the age of 16 in 1972 and recently set up the Hindu Sikh Unity Forum, voiced the sentiments of many when he says, “I can’t understand why people who have chosen to migrate here to build a new life are now fighting for a homeland to which they will never return.\" (With inputs from Anju Agnihotri Chaba)",

      "title": "‘Can&#8217;t let our tribal brothers, sisters be treated in this barbaric way&#8217;: Jharkhand CM writes to President Murmu on Manipur video",
      "text": "Amid protests by tribal organisations in the state on the recent video from Manipur of two women being sexually assaulted by a mob, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren wrote a letter to President Droupadi Murmu on Friday that there is a “grave sense of insecurity among the ethnic groups” residing in Manipur and that \"our tribal brothers and sisters” cannot be treated in an “appallingly barbaric way”. Saying he was compelled to write to Murmu, also from the ST community, as “silence in the face of cruelty is a terrible crime”, he appealed for a way forward. Mentioning that Manipur is “predominantly a tribal state”, Soren said there has been \"a complete silence and a desperate attempt by the Centre to sideline the issue” and “muzzle the voice of the media and the people”. Soren wrote: “.Your (Murmu) steadfast commitment to upholding the principles of justice and compassion has always been a guiding light for all of us. In this darkest hour of crisis that Manipur and India face, we look up to you as the last source of hope and inspiration who could show the light in these troubled times to the people of Manipur and all the citizens of India.” He added, “I appeal to you today, to find a way forward, ensure justice is served and take steps to ensure the peace and harmony of Manipur. We cannot and must not let our fellow tribal brothers and sisters be treated in this appallingly barbaric way. Manipur must heal and we as a nation must help.” Soren said he was distressed and concerned about the spiralling situation in Manipur. “Every day and night, we come across heart-wrenching visuals, with the latest video of women being paraded naked and raped in full public glare. There seems to be a complete breakdown of rule of law and it is deeply distressing that with tacit support of certain vested interests, this ethnic violence continues unabated… The unspeakable barbarism on women has deeply shaken us all. The intrinsic principles of human life and dignity guaranteed by our Constitution seem to be completely broken,” the CM wrote. He added that a society “should never” reach a point where people are subjected to the kind of physical, emotional and psychological brutality that the country saw unfold in Manipur. “Since May 3, India, in spite of being the world's most diverse democracy, has witnessed unparalleled breakdown of peace, unity, justice and democratic governance in Manipur. It has been shocking to note that the state government (Manipur) has failed in protecting its own people and mitigating the violence and unrest…Manipur has been burning for more than two months now. Media reports estimate over 40,000 people including children have been displaced in Manipur and are staying in makeshift camps,” the CM said. On Friday, several tribal bodies took out a protest march in the Jharkhand capital demanding imposition of President's Rule in Manipur following the video of women being paraded naked and sexually assaulted. Around 10 different tribal organisations walked to Albert Ekka Chowk, where the participants raised slogans against the Centre and the Manipur government for allegedly failing to curb the violence which has claimed 160 lives so far and rendered thousands homeless. Kendriya Sarna Samiti (KSS) central president Ajay Tirkey said, \"The incident of two women being paraded naked and molested in public has ashamed the nation. We appeal to President Droupadi Murmu to take serious note of the matter. We demand that President's Rule be imposed in Manipur immediately. The Centre and Manipur government have completely failed to tackle the violence. People have been left to suffer for more than two months. Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh should immediately resign.\" Adivasi Jan Parishad (AJP) president Prem Sahi Munda alleged that the strife in Manipur was allowed to escalate for vote bank politics. with PTI inputs",

      "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's firing of Kyiv's ambassador to the U.K. highlights the sensitivities and difficulties of diplomacy during a war.No reason was given on the president's website for the dismissal of Vadym Prystaiko, but it notably followed his accusation that Zelensky had shown \"sarcasm\" in a dispute over British aid to Kyiv.One member of the Ukrainian parliament told Newsweek that the decision \"reflects the mood and atmosphere of wartime Kyiv.\" But Prystaiko is only the latest of several envoys Zelensky has recalled over the past year.Ambassador to United KingdomPrystaiko had been Kyiv's ambassador to London since 2020 until Zelensky issued a decree on Friday announcing his dismissal. He was also removed from the post of Ukraine's representative to the International Maritime Organization.At this month's NATO summit in Lithuania, British Defense Minister Ben Wallace said that \"people want to see gratitude for the West's military contribution\" to Ukraine to fight Russian aggression, adding that \"I'm not Amazon.\"When asked about the comment, Zelensky gave a tetchy reply, telling journalists \"let him write to me and tell me how I need to thank people so that we can be fully grateful.\" Wallace later said his comments had been \"misrepresented.\"But Prystaiko suggested that Zelensky had taken the wrong approach, telling British broadcaster Sky News ,\"I don't believe this sarcasm is healthy.\"One member of the Ukrainian parliament, who spoke with Newsweek on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the topic, said that Prystaiko's comment was \"an imprudent and unethical statement that under no criteria would suit a professional diplomat.\"\"His remark was clearly a mistake, making an already unpleasant situation even worse. As of the punishment, let me put it this way, it simply reflects the mood and atmosphere of wartime Kyiv.\"Ambassador to GermanyIn July 2022, Zelensky removed Ukraine's ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk after eight years in the post.Melnyk had been a champion of Kyiv's cause in Germany, criticizing what many saw as a slow response from Berlin to supplying Ukraine with weapons following Russia's full-scale invasion.But he was recalled after comments he made during the YouTube show Jung & Naiv in which he defended the memory of Stepan Bandera, the leader of the far-right Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists during World War II.The nationalist group collaborated with Nazi forces when they occupied Ukraine and some of those forces assisted in the mass murders of Poles and Jews.When the interviewer said that Bandera's followers were involved in the \"killing of 800,000 Jews,\" Melnyk replied \"there is zero evidence\" and that it was a narrative pushed by Russia.After his comments were criticized by Israel and Poland, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry declared it was Melnyk's personal opinion. On July 9, Kyiv announced he had been removed from his post. He is currently Ukraine's deputy foreign minister.Ambassador to BelarusUkraine's ambassador to Belarus Ihor Kyzym was recalled from his post in Minsk following a presidential decree published on June 22, 2023.No reason was given for his removal from the post he had held since 2017. However, it coincided with a draft resolution in June by Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, to recognize Belarus as an aggressor state and on breaking diplomatic relations.Ukraine severed diplomatic ties with Moscow after the start of its full-scale invasion but had retained ties with Belarus. The Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko is Vladimir Putin's closest ally, allowing the Russian leader to use his country as a launching pad for attacks and as a storage site for nuclear weapons.India, the Czech RepublicWhen Zelensky announced the dismissal of Melnyk in July 2022, Ukraine's ambassadors to India and the Czech Republic were also removed.\"This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice,\" Zelensky said in a statement.Kyiv's envoy to New Delhi, Igor Polikha, told The Hindu: \"After seven years as ambassador of any country, it is normal to return home.\"Yevhen Perebyinis left his post as envoy to Prague which he had held for five-and-a-half years and now serves as a Ukrainian deputy foreign minister.Following Zelensky's removal of Prystaiko from London, Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told Newsweek that a turnover of envoys was not unusual.\"I think it's normal. Especially during war,\" he said. \"If there is no result there is no point in keeping a person as an ambassador. We need concrete results nowadays—like weapons.\"Newsweek has contacted the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry by email.",

      "text": "Bollywood veteran Anil Kapoor and his son, actor Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor, in a recent interview with the Times of India, shed light on their relationship and how their artistic choices sometimes diverge. The actors discussed their individual journeys in the film industry, comparisons with other Bollywood stars, and how they handle creative differences with utmost honesty. Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor, who made his Bollywood debut with Mirzya in 2016, has maintained a strong stance when it comes to choosing acting projects, even if it contradicts his father's point of view. During the interview, Anil Kapoor admitted to comparing Harsh to other Bollywood actors, but he emphasised that he provides constructive feedback without inflating his son's ego. He said, \"It's very natural. But I do it in a very positive way. I don't pump him unnecessarily or inflate his ego. He is so sharp, he knows if I’m praising him excessively. He will ask me ‘Why are you trying? I can see through you.’ So I have to be very real with him, and keep on giving a reality check.\" Not just his father, Harsh's mother, Sunita Kapoor, also sometimes doesn't agree with his film choices. The actor starred in the Netflix anthology Ray (2021), which garnered mixed reviews from audiences and critics. After watching the film, Sunita, expressed pride for her son's performance while also urging him to meet her halfway in terms of a project's mass appeal. She wrote on Instagram, \"A little late to the party… I saw Spotlight yesterday and I am so proud and overwhelmed by the film and your performance. Glad you are creating an impact by following your path!!! More power to you. Love you (but please can you meet me halfway to my taste and sensibilities.)Please!.\" Responding to her mother's comment, Harsh said that he doesn't understand 'the halfway thing' and believes in cultivating one's own taste and clearly pursue it. \"That’s what being an artist is about. Over time, you will find excellence through our individuality,\" he said. The creative differences between the father-son duo occasionally lead to heated arguments, as Anil Kapoor admitted during the interview. He said, \"We have major fights.\" Talking about how differently they deal with an argument, Harsh said, \"He (Anil) gets really anxious and can't sit down and talk,\" while he prefers having a detailed chat. Despite different artistic perspectives, Harsh and his father found common ground as co-stars and producers in the 2022 Netflix film Thar.",

      "title": "Sick of hearing about record heat? Scientists say those numbers paint the story of a warming world",
      "text": "The summer of 2023 is behaving like a broken record about broken records. Nearly every major climate-tracking organization proclaimed June the hottest June ever. Then July 4 became the globe's hottest day, albeit unofficially, according to the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer. It was quickly overtaken by July 5 and July 6. Next came the hottest week, a tad more official, stamped into the books by the World Meteorological Organization and the Japanese Meteorological Agency. With a summer of extreme weather records dominating the news, meteorologists and scientists say records like these give a glimpse of the big picture: a warming planet caused by climate change. It's a picture that comes in the vibrant reds and purples representing heat on daily weather maps online, in newspapers and on television. Beyond the maps and the numbers are real harms that kill. More than 100 people have died in heat waves in the United States and India so far this summer. Records are crucial for people designing infrastructure and working in agriculture because they need to plan for the worst scenarios, said Russell Vose, climate analysis group director for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He also chairs a committee on national records. In the past 30 days, nearly 5,000 heat and rainfall records have been broken or tied in the U.S. and more than 10,000 records set globally, according to NOAA. Texas cities and towns alone have set 369 daily high temperature records since June 1. Since 2000, the U.S. has set about twice as many records for heat as those for cold. “Records go back to the late 19th century and we can see that there has been a decade-on-decade increase in temperatures,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, keeper of the agency's climate records. “What’s happening now is certainly increasing the chances that 2023 will be the warmest year on record. My calculations suggest that there’s, right now, a 50-50 chance.” The larger the geographic area and the longer stretch of time during which records are set, the more likely the conditions represent climate change rather than daily weather. So the hottest global June is “extremely unlikely” to happen without climate change, as opposed to one city's daily record, Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon said. Still, some local specifics are striking: Death Valley has flirted this summer with the hottest temperature in modern history, though that 134 degree Fahrenheit (56.7 Celsius ) record is in dispute. Phoenix grabbed headlines among major U.S. cities on Tuesday when it marked a 19th consecutive day of unrelenting mega heat: 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 Celsius) or more. It kept going, reaching a 22nd straight day on Friday. The daytime heat was accompanied by a record stretch of nights that never fell below 90 Fahrenheit (32.2 Celsius). “Everybody’s drawn to extremes,” Vose said. “It’s like the Guinness Book of World Records. Human nature is just drawn to the extreme things out of curiosity.” But the numbers can be flawed in what they portray. The scientific community “doesn’t really have the vocabulary to communicate what it feels like,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field, who co-chaired a groundbreaking United Nations report in 2012 warning of the dangers of extreme weather from climate change. “I don’t think it captures the human sense, but it really does underscore that we live in a different world,” Field said of the records. Think of the individual statistics as brush strokes in a painting of the world’s climate, Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald said. “The details of course matter, but the thing that really matters, especially for the impressionist painting, is when you step back and take a look at everything that’s happening,” Mahowald said. She and other climate scientists say long-term warming from burning coal, oil and natural gas is the chief cause of rising temperatures, along with occasional boosts from natural El Nino warmings across parts of the Pacific, like the planet is experiencing this year. El Nino is a natural temporary warming of parts of the Pacific that changes weather patterns worldwide and adds an extra warm boost. An El Nino formed in June and scientists say this one looks strong. For the previous three years El Nino’s cool flip side, La Nina, dampened a bit of the heat humans are causing. A super El Nino spiked global temperatures in 1998, then was followed by less warming and even some flat temperatures for a few years until the next big El Nino, Mahowald said. Weather won’t worsen each year and that should not become a common expectation, but it will intensify over the long run, she said. The University of Michigan’s Richard Rood used to blog about climate records for Weather Underground, but in 2014 he got sick of continuously new extremes and stopped.“I think we need to get away from that sort of record-setting sensationalism at some level and really be getting down to the hard work,” he said, addressing the need for people to adapt to a warmer world and get serious about slashing emissions causing hotter, more extreme weather. NOAA tracks weather observations from tens of thousands of stations throughout the U.S. and its global calculations incorporate data from more than 100,000 stations, Vose said. When those records come in, the agency checks their quality and calculates where the numbers fit historically. NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information in North Carolina is the arbiter of national records, while the local National Weather Service offices handle those for individual cities, Vose said. A special international committee deals with world records and, at times, scientists disagree on the reliability of 100-year-old data. Those disagreements come into play over questions such as determining the hottest temperature recorded on Earth. Validating records takes time. Because of a backlog of extreme weather events to analyze, officials haven't finished approving 130 degree Fahrenheit records from 2020 and 2021 at Death Valley, Vose said. “Our primary job is keeping score, meaning what happened? How unusual was it?” he asked. “It’s not like we take great joy in saying it was the warmest year on record. Again.” It’s the bigger picture that matters, Northern Illinois University climate scientist Victor Gensini said. “Look at them all together in the aggregate sense of the atmospheric orchestra,” Gensini said. “There are so many clear signs that we are just not living in the same type of climate that we were.”",

      "title": "FBI zeroes in on cold-case murder mystery on NY Oneida reservation",
      "text": "ONEIDA, NY – Early this month, Debbie Mahoney woke from a nightmare. Her long-lost little sister Tammy, last seen on a tiny Native American reservation in Oneida, NY, in 1981 and believed to have been gang-raped and murdered, came to her in a disturbing dream. “It’s like she won’t rest until this case is solved,” Mahoney said. It’s been 42 years since 19-year-old Tammy, a SUNY Morrisville student from Farmingdale, Long Island, was picked up while hitchhiking to a friend’s house. Cops say she was taken to the nearby 32-acre Oneida Nation Territory in what people up here, including the Natives, still call “Indian country.” Now, her disappearance and presumed murder is one of the hottest cold cases in the country. The FBI held a news conference in May saying the case was still active and that several new witnesses have come forward. Recently, the State Police’s Major Crimes and Cold Case units joined the investigation. Police told The Post that they think they’ve known who killed her from the start. At least 13 people were present at a party in a trailer on the Oneida Nation Territory, a small reservation in Oneida which was then a ramshackle, mud-filled stretch of land filled with mobile homes. Investigators say it was “suggested” to them by these witnesses that Mahoney, who may have known some Oneida Nation members, was gang-raped and killed. But since the crime allegedly occurred on sovereign Native American land, it’s been difficult to both investigate the case and get witnesses on the record. At the time of her disappearance, local police were not allowed on the Oneida Territory without permission and there had been violence between the residents and law enforcement at times. “We know who the bad guys are and they know that we know,” said former Oneida Police detective and former Madison County Undersheriff Doug Bailey, 76, who’s been investigating the case for decades. “I hope they still are looking over their shoulder every minute of every day of their life. They’re local, they’re here … I see them in the aisles at Walmart.” Bailey was so focused on the Mahoney case that he visited Tammy’s mother, Jean, who died in 2020, in Long Island and his mother and Jean became pen pals. Jean also took Bailey and his wife to a gravesite near Farmingdale which is still waiting for Tammy’s remains should they be found. “It’s so hard that she passed without any closure,” Bailey told The Post. “But I’ll tell you there are people around here who should be scared to death right now. There are also people who’ve been carrying around a very dark secret for decades and they should unburden themselves.” The timeline in Tammy’s case is astonishing for the number of stops and starts, clues and dozens of so far-fruitless digs in the area that have taken place since she was last seen on May 8, 1981. Bailey said he and his team investigated more than 900 leads over the years. One primary person of interest has died and another killed himself, according to Post interviews with multiple sources.The Post was unable to contact two other men who are reportedly persons of interest and still living in the area. Mahoney had been studying animal husbandry at SUNY Morrisville but dropped out her sophomore year. She had been working as a groomer at a local horse stable and seeing a local man, Karl Lockwood, who was questioned early on but quickly cleared as a suspect. FBI agents reportedly made visits to residents of the Onondaga reservation, a bigger Native American territory 40 miles from the Oneida Nation Territory, as recently as last week in their latest efforts to persuade more witnesses to Mahoney’s disappearance to come forward. Numerous members of the Oneida Nation told The Post that they believe Mahoney was taken to the party on the Oneida Territory, transported to the Onondaga reservation, and then brought back to the Oneida land where she was killed. “This crime is a tricky one but we have a lot of confidence that it will be solved,” Sarah Ruane, 40, of the FBI’s Albany office told The Post. “We have a mix of old and new information and we think we can bring this case to the finish line. The goal is a successful prosecution of the perpetrators and finally being able to lay Tammy to rest.” Complicating the investigation is the shadow cast here by the historical trauma suffered by the original Oneida Indian Nation, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, who came to the aid of Americans against the British in the Revolutionary War but later lost about 3.5 million acres of their land here in illegal state land grabs and sales. Local Oneida members told The Post there are only 500 adult Oneida left in the area. The majority of the original Oneida left for Wisconsin and Canada in the early 1800s when they began losing their land in New York. But one man, Ray Halbritter, who is one-quarter Oneida, who has almost singlehandedly revived the Oneida fortunes in the area — though not without some controversy. The 72-year-old’s name came up repeatedly when The Post visited the area to ask locals about Mahoney’s disappearance. He’s not considered a suspect in the case but a number of local Oneida, and some non-Oneida residents, all said his power and influence have contributed to the reluctance of those who allegedly witnessed Mahoney’s last hours to give testimony to law enforcement. Halbritter was born and raised about 165 miles away, moved to the Oneida Territory in his early 20s and began selling cigarettes out of a shack, and later opened a small bingo hall. On paper, Halbritter looks like a Native American hero: He’s managed so far to buy back at least 25,000 acres of what was ancestral land and had it put in a federal trust. Halbritter’s meteoric entrepreneurial and political rise — he was named a spokesman for the Oneida Indian Nation in 1975 — was just getting underway at the time of Tammy’s disappearance. A source close to the Mahoney investigation said Halbritter was interviewed in connection with the case but was not considered a suspect. Today, Halbritter is the CEO of Oneida Nation Enterprises and the multi-millionaire owner of the Turning Stone Resort Casino a few miles from where he first sold cigarettes on the Oneida Territory. He also owns many local gas stations and Sav-On drugstores. Halbritter is now one of the most powerful men in central New York — thanks in part to land and gambling deals made first with Gov. Mario Cuomo and then his son, Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Halbritter, who successfully campaigned for the Washington Redskins NFL football team to change its name, is also controversial — especially among two warring factions of the local Oneida. Though some local Natives admire him and call him “the boss” or the “go-to guy,” others complain that he’s dictatorial and doesn’t share his fortune. Some Oneida did not want the tribe to go into gambling. The Post visited both the Oneida and Onondaga reservations this month and spoke to a number of Oneida Nation and Onondaga members about the case. The Oneida said they receive a yearly stipend of $16,000 from the Oneida Nation, which Halbritter controls. “It’s a small reservation, literally a one-road community,” Sonny Manos, who grew up on the Oneida Territory, told The Post. He added that many residents feel reluctance about whether to “open their mouth.” Halbritter declined to comment when reached by phone and referred questions to his spokesman, Joel Barkin, a former strategist for US Sen. Bernie Sanders as well as for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC.) When asked about Mahoney’s disappearance. Barkin said that Halbritter’s own police force, the Oneida Indian Nation Police Department (which is comprised of almost all Caucasian officers), has worked closely with local police and the FBI on the case and, in 2019, offered a $20,000 match to a $20,000 reward offered by the FBI for information that solves the case. “The Oneida Indian Nation is hopeful that our collective efforts will help solve the case and bring closure for the Mahoney family and our community,” Barkin said in an email. Halbritter’s adversaries are many and include Congresswoman Claudia Tenney (R-New Hartford), who has accused Halbritter of corruption and for misrepresenting his heritage, even once calling him “Spray Tan Ray.” Barkin told The Post that questioning Halbritter’s heritage is “false and offensive” and said that he has “generated hundreds of millions of dollars for the state and local counties, in consideration for, among other things, the state’s recognition of Oneida’s sovereign right to pursue responsible land use and economic development initiatives without interference.” Tenney helped one of Halbritter’s chief nemeses, the full-blooded Oneida Indian Melvin L. “Smokey” Phillips, pro bono in an 18-year fight against Halbritter. Phillips, who died last month at age 85, was embroiled in complex, still-ongoing lawsuits involving land in Oneida that he and his ancestors claim to have held for more than 200 years and preserved in an 1842 treaty that was codified into state law. Tenney told The Post that Halbritter was trying to take Phillips’ land; Joel Barkin said in response that Phillips was trying to sell his land to non-Indians. Doug George-Kaentiio, a Akwesasne Mohawk who lives right near the Oneida Territory, was married to the most famous Oneida in recent years, Grammy Award-winning Native American singer Joanne Shenandoah who died in 2021 at age 64 and was Halbritter’s cousin. She grew up on the Oneida territory and her mother was a clan matriarch. George-Kaentiio, an author and journalist, gave a detailed account of what he said happened to Mahoney but The Post was unable to verify it. “It’s a terrible and sad story what happened to that girl and it haunts this community to this day,” he said. “[Police] keep collecting testimonials and say they’re close to making an arrest but never do.” George-Kaentiio told The Post that he and his wife and her family fought Halbritter for years because they did not want the Oneida going into gaming. George-Kaentiio said that Halbritter and his ally, the late US Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, made deals that went as far up as the Clinton administration. The deals resulted in Halbritter being named the formal leader of the Oneida in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton. That same year Halbritter signed a gambling compact with then-Gov. Mario Cuomo and gambling was introduced in New York State. “My wife suffered because she didn’t go along with Halbritter,” George-Kaentiio said. “Some of her relatives moved away because of him. It’s very frustrating.” In 2017, Mahoney’s high school classmate and good friend Theresa Humphrey co-founded the Facebook group Justice for Tammy Mahoney, which has more than 7,000 members and tries to keep the heat on cops and the FBI to keep on her case. “I’d like to see the men who did this put in shackles and arrested,” Humphrey, also 61, told The Post. “Then I want to coordinate a memorial for Tammy down here in Farmingdale.” Humphrey said she met Tammy when the two were about 7 or 8 and they went through elementary and high school together. “I lived two blocks away from her,” Humphrey said. “We grew up together. We had a real camaraderie. We always used to go to Jones Beach as teenagers. The last time I saw her we were at Jones Beach. I begged her not to go upstate. I wanted her to stay here.” Marlene Mahoney Laccesaglia, Tammy’s younger sister, spoke at the FBI’s May press conference. “I was in tenth grade at the time,” Laccesaglia said. “It was a terrible experience … the uncertainty and not knowing what happened initially …When my mother was alive, she would say a prayer for Tammy every night.” Laccesaglia hopes people who know what happened to her sister will come forward. Anyone with information concerning this case is asked to contact the FBI’s Albany Office at 315-731-1781 or their local FBI office.",

      "title": "'Barbenheimer' Makes Noise As Movie Fans Flock To Theaters On Opening Weekend",
      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Waves of pink-clad moviegoers passed under cardboard palm trees on the frenzied first day of “Barbenheimer.” After a feverish drumbeat propelled forward by a mushroom cloud of memes, the most anticipated day on the year’s movie calendar finally arrived as “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” — two movie opposites brought together by cross-marketing fate — landed in theaters. “I think it’s the contrast,” said Lucy Ruiz, 17, as she and a friend made their way into the first showing of “Barbie” on Thursday at the Alamo Drafthouse in Yonkers, New York. “If you want to do both in the same day, it’s like two sides of the same coin.” For Ruiz, the second half of her “Barbenheimer” would have to wait. “Maybe next week,” she said of seeing “Oppenheimer.” But many are flocking to see both on opening weekend. The National Association of Theater Owners says some 200,000 moviegoers in North America have booked same-day tickets to each movie. The movie of the summer has turned out to be not “Indiana Jones” or “The Flash,” but a double feature. “I don’t think I’ve seen anything like this,” says Michael O’Leary, president of the theater association, who compared the phenomenon to a sold-out Taylor Swift concert tour. “But while that’s an amazing special event that captures the cultural attention, it’s not accessible to everybody the way these two movies are. This is a phenomenon open to everyone, regardless of where they live.” As of Friday, it was already clear “Barbenheimer” had morphed into the movie event of the year. The collision of Greta Gerwig’s bright satire of the Mattel doll and Christopher Nolan’s three-hour opus on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb, wasn’t cannibalizing ticket sales for either but fueling excitement for the most jarring and color-clashing of movie weekends. Studios forecasts had hovered around an $80 million opening weekend for “Barbie” and about $40 million for “Oppenheimer.” But it’s likely that both will greatly exceed those totals, and maybe even — especially in the case of “Barbie” — double them. Warner Bros. said Friday that “Barbie” took in $22.5 million in Thursday previews, the best such tally of the year and a clear sign that the film will easily sail past $100 million for the weekend. Universal Pictures’ “Oppenheimer” notched $10.5 million in preshow ticket sales, a likewise strong start. “Barbenheimer” is poised to be not just a viral trend but a box-office behemoth. For a movie industry that still hasn’t entirely recovered its pre-pandemic footing, it’s a much-needed jolt of moviegoing joy in a summer season where many of the top releases have fallen shy of expectations. Overall sales on the year are running about 20% below the box-office pace of 2019. As much as the “Barbenheimer” fanfare has been driven by internet fascination, it’s in many ways an old-school movie weekend. Both movies are roundly acclaimed, original works by two of the best filmmakers working today. “Oppenheimer” has been hailed as a masterpiece; in my review, I called it “a kinetic thing of dark, imposing beauty.” The Associated Press’ Jocelyn Noveck called “Barbie” “brash, clever, idea-packed (if ultimately TOO packed) and most of all eye-poppingly lovely.” For some moviegoers, “Barbenheimer” is their first blush with the once common practice of catching a double feature. Jack Robinson, 17, had tickets to see both movies with friends Saturday. He planned to don a suit for “Oppenheimer” before changing into pink for “Barbie.” “I used to go to the movies a lot with my family and friends before corona happened. I’m very excited,” said Robinson. “It’ll be interesting to not leave the movie theater. Usually, it’s like bathroom and go home.” In recent years, theater owners have often bemoaned not having enough films in the marketplace as streaming made inroads and studios increasingly concentrated their release schedules on fewer but bigger films. But “Barbenheimer” points to the possible reward when a varied group of films collective rise the box-office tide. “Barbenheimer” may have momentarily eclipsed last week’s top film, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” — which, despite Tom Cruise’s lobbying, is losing IMAX screens to “Oppenheimer” this weekend. But having three big movies in close proximity to one other, O’Leary said, “is a good problem to have.” “It’s certainly preferable to the alternative,” said O’Leary. Parrot Analytics found that global demand for the casts of each film — all of whom have been publicly enthusiastic about seeing their rival movie — grew at virtually the same rate between late April and mid-July. The audience demographics are almost opposite one another. “Barbie” is appealing to a largely female and younger audience, while “Oppenheimer” is most popular with males and those over the age of 30, Parrot found. Yet in a much-divided America, “Barbenheimer” has been the great pop-culture unifier of 2023. There is harmony in contrast. “I’m doing ‘Barbie’ first and then ‘Oppenheimer’ because I know ‘Oppenheimer’ is going to be something I have to digest,” says Jill Kupnick of Brooklyn. Movie theaters are catering to the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon with double feature tickets and plenty of “Barbie”-themed promotions of candy and cocktails. But most are programming their own “Barbenheimer” days. Freelance writer Kelsey Weekman called it “the closest we’ve come to having school spirit week as adults.” “I have a friend who has outfits picked out and knows how she’s styling her hair,” Krupnick says. “There’s a level of play involved that you rarely see in more mainstream cinema. It’s more common with Marvel movies or in the fantasy genre than something like this.” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” have melded together so much that it’s become possible — despite their vast differences — to confuse one for the other. At the Yonkers Alamo Drafthouse, a sharply dressed man wearing a pink shirt beneath a blazer inquired about showtimes for “Oppenheimer.” A clerk courteously answered and then, noticing the man’s attire, asked, “Did you want times for ‘Barbie,’ too?” ___ Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP",

Instead, Malik was produced in person before the court. Its definitely a gross lapse on our part, Baniwal said.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta has termed Maliks appearance in the Supreme Court as a major security lapse.Mehta has written to the Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, seeking action against prison officials.How the separatist leader was allowed to step out in the absence of any order or authorisation from court warranting his presence? Mehta asked. Govt Raises Concern Over Yasin Malik rsquo;s Appearance In SC: Heres WhyMalik had arrived at the Supreme Court to appear in an appeal filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation, challenging a September 2022 order passed by a TADA court in Jammu.The order required Maliks personal presence in the trial relating to the killing of four Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel in Srinagar in 1990 and the 1989 abduction of Rubaiya Sayeed, daughter of then Union Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.The Supreme Court on April 24 had stayed this order, thereby issuing notice to the respondents, including Malik to appear either in person or through an authorised lawyer.

      "title": "Learn from Chhath, strive for behavioural change: IIT profs say Patna’s waste disposal problem needs long-term solution",
      "text": "Recognising that Patna has a waste management problem, and that the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the issue, two academics have conducted a study and released a book that not only raises the alarm, but also offers suggestions for Bihar’s capital city. Papia Raj and Aditya Raj, both associate professors at IIT Patna and authors of Discard Studies India: A Case of Patna, say that medical waste and plastic waste pose major problems in the city. “We found to our dismay that only the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences has an incinerator to burn medical waste (in Patna). Though the hospital offers this service to other hospitals for a charge, seldom does any government or private hospital use it. It is a common perception that domestic waste is the main problem, but medical and plastic waste is a much bigger threat,” they told The Indian Express. According to them, even though the Covid-19 pandemic had initially brought about behavioural changes among people regarding sanitation, recently, a reversal of these changes has been observed. They said that the medical waste generated during the pandemic has also caused major issues. “The Covid pandemic has further complicated the problem in Patna and is creating a parallel pandemic like situation,” they wrote, pointing to un-incinerated medical waste disposed openly near human habitations. “The Covid pandemic requires renewed efforts to comprehend discard. While we kept battling the pandemic, we kept creating so much waste,” they added. The authors, Papia Raj and Aditya Raj, who are also married to each other, focussed their study on an urban area covering a population of 25 lakh. The city produces around 1,200 tonnes of waste per day. When looking for a solution to the city’s garbage problem, the authors said it was important to learn from the cleanliness drive carried out during the four-day Chhath festival in October-November. “Chhath puja conveys a totally different scenario in Patna. The streets are neat and clean. Production or disposal of waste is done with utmost care. During the build up to this festival, celebrated six days after Diwali, behaviour pattern and attitude of residents, governance, and other stakeholders are seen to have totally changed. People seem to care for their locality,” they said. Such a change in attitude has the potential to change people’s behavioural patterns and can have a positive impact on the proper disposal of waste, not just in Patna, but in other places that may also be struggling with similar issues, they said. They also suggested programmes supported by local communities and authorities to raise awareness about waste disposal. “We feel modern in criticising our traditions. Even those traditional practices which made us live in rhythm with Mother Nature, appreciating our people and our products. Earlier, the community of practice meant the cosmos to its members. We have opened up and the whole globe is attested to be our home. While we proudly claim to be living in the global village, we do not know our neighbours. We do not bother to know either. Neither are we concerned about our neighbourhood. We dispose of what we do not need, at will, without care or concern. Our practices have started to bite us. We need to change. We need to respect even our discard,” they wrote. The authors also suggested that the government should encourage ventures in the discard business. “In Bihar, we do not have business ventures dealing with discard. Whatever is collected, starting from door-to-door collection, is processed and sent to places like Gujarat for recycling,” they said. The IIT study said that because there aren’t many industries in Patna, a large portion of the waste is generated from households, hotels, resorts, restaurants, and other businesses. “Segregation of waste is not the only solution, but dealing with the waste at its source could provide the solution. The ongoing Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is one way to deal with it, but our long lasting solution is involvement of the community,” Papia Raj and Aditya Raj said.",

      "text": "It’s clear the apple hasn’t fallen far from the tree. After all, Cuban likes to boast that he “invented the word ‘side hustle,'” as he started his business career selling garbage bags door-to-door at 12 years old. In fact, long before he became a billionaire, Cuban engaged in a long series of money-making gigs, from collecting stamps and coins as a kid to selling dance lessons as a college student at Indiana University. “I was a hustler …. I have always been selling,” Cuban said during a 2016 “Shark Tank” episode. “I always had something going on. That was just my nature.” Eventually, Cuban was able to turn those skills into more than just extra cash. He sold his first business, MicroSolutions, to CompuServe for $6 million in 1990. He became a billionaire less than a decade later, when Yahoo paid $5.7 billion in stock for his streaming audio service, Broadcast.com. Despite his own business success, though, Cuban has been adamant that he doesn’t expect any of his three children to copy his path. “I tell them, ‘After your health, my No. 1 thing for you all is, I don’t want you to be entitled jerks,'” Cuban said in a 2020 interview with another comedian, Steve Harvey. Talking to Hart, Cuban noted that his son may be showing signs of becoming an entrepreneur, but his two older daughters have other interests. Sixteen-year-old Alyssa is more of an “artist,” he told Hart, while his oldest daughter, Alexis, is a college student and hasn’t settled on a career path yet. “She has the world in front of her wherever she decides to go,” Cuban said. While he’s “proud” of Jake’s hustling attitude, the billionaire says he just wants his children to be “healthy and happy.” His advice to them is, “‘Do what you want [and] figure out who you are. You don’t need to follow in my footsteps.'” Disclosure: Peacock and CNBC are owned by the same parent company, NBCUniversal. Sign up for our new newsletter!

      "title": "Is India's Reliance on Russian Oil Imports Reaching a Limit | Explained",
      "text": "India’s imports of oil from Russia reached a new height as New Delhi’s daily volumes climbed to 2.2 million barrels a day in June. The Russian purchases exceeded the combined shipments of Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Though New Delhi’s trade with Russia reached new volumes, there are speculations that, India’s appetite may have peaked and going to decrease over the months. Reports also pointed out that it is getting tougher to pay Russia and the perils of paying in Chinese yuan, amid India’s strained ties with Beijing. News18 takes a look at India’s oil trade with Russia and the future possibilities: Rapid Rise of Russian Oil India, the world’s third largest consumer of crude, bought nearly 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian crude in June, which was the highest for the country. In May, India had imported a record 1.95 million bpd from Russia. This handout image shows smoke rising from a fire at an oil refinery in the southern Krasnodar region’s Ilsky settlement. (AFP Photo) Moscow continued to be the single largest supplier of crude oil to India for the eighth straight month and made up for 42% of all oil India imported. India also became Russia’s second largest export market for crude. According to data from the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics India’s oil imports from Russia have grown more than 10 times since April 2022. Imports from Other countries Before Ukraine war, that began in February 2022, Russia was a marginal player in India’s oil trade, which was dominated by Middle Eastern countries like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). However, the recent trade data shows that India’s June imports of Russian oil exceeded its combined purchases from Iraq and Saudi Arabia, the second and third biggest sellers to New Delhi. US emerged as the fourth-largest supplier to India, pushing UAE to the fifth place, the data showed. A general view of the Guwahati Refinery operated by Indian Oil Corporation is pictured in Guwahati. (Photo by Biju BORO / AFP) While Russia supplied about 42% of India’s crude oil imports, the Middle East countries’ share rose to about 41% after slipping in the previous three months. Imports from the Middle East fell by about 34% in the June quarter that a year ago, while those from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia nearly tripled. Why India Increased Oil Imports from Russia? India increased supply of Russian oil imports since Russia began selling it at a discount following western sanctions in the wake of the Ukraine war last year as Moscow wanted to plug the gap in its energy exports. Before the Ukraine war, India rarely bought oil from Russia because of the high freight costs. However, after the Western sanctions, there were plentiful Russian cargo available at a discount to supply oil. Oil India produced 0.81 million tonnes of crude oil in October-December, up from 0.75 million tonnes a year back. (Image: Reuters) The average cost of Russian crude oil including the freight costs landing on Indian shores was $68.21 a barrel in April, the lowest level since the Ukraine war. Meanwhile, the average cost of Saudi Arabian crude sent to India was $86.96 a barrel, while Iraqi oil was priced at $77.77 a barrel in the same month. Return Back to Middle East? According to reports, India’s appetite for Russian oil may have peaked in June and going to decrease over the next months. Moreover, the Russian discounts is slowly eroding in recent weeks. It is also getting tougher for India to pay for the Russian oil imports as it faces repercussions of breaching the oil price cap of $60 a barrel set by the West, according to The Hindu. India has also recently started making payments to Russia using currencies like the Chinese yuan, but the use of currency has its own geopolitical ramifications amid New Delhi’s strained ties with Beijing. Moreover, the recent Wanger Mutiny has challenged the political stability in Russia and also briefly alarmed the oil market before the mercenary group surrendered. However, it is early to say if Russian imports will significantly dwindle in coming months and the chances of India likely increasing its import from the US and traditional trading partner in the Middle East.",

      "title": "‘Imagine being named after’ is the funniest meme on the internet right now",
      "text": "The thing about social media humour is that it is unhinged, unprovoked, and spreads like wildfire. The latest social media meme that everyone is picking up, be it law enforcement agencies or fast-food chains, is one called ‘Imagine being named after’. In a world of hyper-commodification where brands appear to hold more value than any other cultural, historical, or geographical entity, many of these memes poke fun at famous or common things that share their name with an equally popular brand. For instance, food delivery platform Swiggy shared a map of Bikaner, a city in Rajasthan, and wrote “imagine being named after bhujiya”. A Twitter user shared a picture of the Statue of Liberty and wrote “imagine being named after a shoe company”, referring to popular Indian footwear brand Liberty Shoes Limited. Mumbai police, in their typical social media-savvy style, shared a picture of a zebra on Instagram and wrote, “Imagine being named after a pedestrian crossing’. It is unclear what provoked this meme template, but it is all over the internet now. In recent weeks, many memes have been inspired by Hollywood’s big releases Barbie and Oppenheimer. In April, soon after the first trailer of Barbie was released, a tagline from the film’s poster, “She’s everything. He’s just Ken,” became a meme template. Netizens initially used the tagline to show a couple in which the woman is far better than her male partner, for instance, Elle Woods and Warner Huntington III from the 2001 romantic comedy Legally Blonde as well as Princess Diana and Prince Charles. However, soon people began using the meme to compare two competing entities. For instance, the University of York also used the meme template to compare itself with its rival, Lancaster University.",

      "title": "What is an adjournment motion, moved by Congress MPs in Parliament?",
      "text": "As Opposition parties demanded a discussion on the alleged sexual assault of at least two women in Manipur, amid the ongoing ethnic violence in the state, the day two of the Monsoon Session of Parliament proceedings saw the Lok Sabha being adjourned on Friday (July 21). The adjournment happened barely a few minutes after a brief statement on the issue by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. On the same day, Congress MPs Manickam Tagore and Hibi Eden moved adjournment motions in the Lok Sabha, citing the need for urgent discussions on the ethnic violence in Manipur. Writing to the Secretary-General of Lok Sabha, the MPs separately urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speak on the matter and for the government to “uphold its constitutional commitment to protect religious minorities and Scheduled Tribes”. The proceedings will now resume on Monday. The routine adjournment of Parliament – what happened on Friday – is simply indicative of the day’s work ending. Normally, Parliament is in session at 11 am and concludes at 6 pm, with a break in the middle. The Speaker has the power to decide when the House is adjourned. What are adjournment motions and how do they differ from regular adjournments and the other motions raised in Parliament? What are the various motions raised in Indian Parliament? In both the houses of Parliament, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, there are ways for Members of Parliament to draw the attention of the house to any relevant issue. For this, there are various procedures given. MR Madhavan, the President and co-founder of PRS Legislative Research, wrote in The Indian Express in 2012, “There are four main procedures under which there could be a discussion in the Lok Sabha — a debate without voting under Rule 193, a motion (with a vote) under Rule 184, and an adjournment motion or a no-confidence motion.” Except the last one, similar measures also exist in the Rajya Sabha. Rule 193, Short Duration Discussion Short Duration Discussions can also take place in Lok Sabha under Rule 193 of its rules and in Rajya Sabha under Rule 176 of its rules. On Thursday, disagreement over which rule shall be invoked for a discussion on Manipur led to the adjournment of Rajya Sabha for the day. Under Rule 176 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Rajya Sabha, “If the Chairman is satisfied… that the matter is urgent and is of sufficient public importance to be raised in the Council at an early date, he may admit the notice and in consultation with the Leader of the Council fix the date on which such matter may be taken up for discussion and allow such time for discussion, not exceeding two and a half hours…” The government had agreed to this being invoked, while Opposition parties favoured a longer period for discussion. Leader of the Opposition and Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said, “We have also given notices under 267…..you have to suspend all other business and take up this.” The Opposition instead wanted Rule 267 to be invoked, under which Rajya Sabha MPs can give a written notice to suspend all listed business and discuss an issue of importance. You can read this explainer for more on that. Rule 184, a motion with a vote If a motion on a matter of general public interest satisfies certain conditions, such as that it “shall not contain arguments, inferences, ironical expressions, imputations or defamatory statements”, “shall be restricted to a matter of recent occurrence”, and so on, then that motion can be admitted. Also, motions on a matter pending before any statutory authority (one established by law) or any commission or court of enquiry cannot be moved. However, in Lok Sabha, the Speaker can allow for such a matter to be raised at his own discretion. It must be concerned with the “procedure or subject or stage of enquiry” of an issue, and if the Speaker is satisfied that it is not likely to prejudice the consideration of such matter by the relevant authority that takes it up. The Speaker can then allot a time period for the discussion of any such motion. “Here, the debate is on a specific question, and this is followed by a vote to determine Parliament’s position on the issue. Passage of a motion would require the government to follow Parliament’s decision on the issue. Such motions are not very common. For example, in August 2011, opposition parties had demanded a debate with voting on the issue of rising prices. However, the motion that was moved did not require any specific action and only called upon the government,” Madhavan wrote. And what is an adjournment motion, moved by Congress MPs recently? A motion for an adjournment of the business of the House is moved for discussing a “definite matter of urgent public importance”, with the Speaker’s consent. The notice for this is to be given before 10 am on a given day to the Lok Sabha Secretary-General. This is not a provision available in the Rajya Sabha. Just like the motion with a vote, it should fulfill a list of criteria and can then be admitted. The Speaker, after being satisfied that there has been adequate debate, can put up a question afterwards. “Passage of an adjournment motion does not require the government to resign. However, it is seen as a strong censure of the government,” Madhavan wrote.",

      "text": "Entertainment Why Indians Are Upset With Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy And Censor Board admin July 22, 2023 0 5 min read Home Entertainment Oppenheimer Sex Scene Debate Explained: Why Indians Are Upset With Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy And Censor Board A sex scene in Christopher Nolan’s movie Oppenheimer has brought the Censor Board under fire. It shows Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh getting intimate. Here’s what the whole issue is about. Oppenheimer Sex Scene Debate Explained Why Indians Are Upset With Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy And Censor Board Oppenheimer has taken a fabulous opening at the Box Office India. The word-of-mouth around the film has been strong and the fans of Christopher Nolan have been especially excited to explore the Bhagavad Gita connect in the film. However, little did anyone know that the film would be carrying a scene with the potential to upset the larger masses in India. What is in The Controversial Sex Scene From Oppenheimer? The Cillian Murphy starrer has come under fire for a particular scene in which the actor is seen reading Bhagavad Gita while having sex. The scene in question has created an uproar on social media with a section of the audience calling it a disrespect to the sentiments of Hindus and the Hindu holy book. Cillian’s Oppenheimer and Florence Pugh‘s Jean are seen engaged in intercourse when the latter walks to his bookshelf and picks up the Gita. After being failed to understand the language, she gives it to Oppie to read as they engage in the sexual act. Oppie takes Lod Vishnu’s name and reads from the holy book of the Hindus while engaging in the act. The Indian version of the film doesn’t show nudity, the act of intimacy is clear in the scene. Oppenheimer’s Sex Scene Creates Uproar in India The fact that the Censor Board let the scene make the final cut of the movie in India without thinking of its repercussions – has emerged as a big debate on social media. While a section is debating how one should simply enjoy the film without bringing their sentiments in between, another section is adamant and has called for the boycott of the film in India. One Twitter user wrote, “Hundreds of lessons about history & science but people chose to get offended over how Bhagwad Gita was recited during a Sex scene. People can’t enjoy any movie without getting their religious sentiments hurt (sic).” Another user slammed Nolan for not being able to respect the Hindu culture in its full essence and using it to grab eyeballs for his film. “Shame on India’s censor board for allowing this. Christopher Nolan is a typical Hollywood racist. He completely shut out all the Indian fighters in WWI movie and now he is making crude sexual references to Hinduism. Porno perverts from the West again exploit Hindu texts (sic),” he wrote.

      "text": "A den of snakes was found at a kutcha house in Uttar Pradesh's Bhadohi. What initially began as the sighting of two reptiles in the house soon turned into a much more alarming discovery, with almost a dozen snakes being found later on. Subsequently, forest department officials were informed about it and asked to take them away safely. The incident was in Devajitpur village, situated near Bhadohi district. The homeowner, Awadhesh, first saw two snakes on his premises a couple of days ago and later, 12 of them had appeared in his house. He managed to capture all the snakes and safely place them inside a bucket, awaiting the authorities to come to their rescue.\"My brother was lying in the house and he saw the snake first. One or two snakes were killed, but after that, many snakes came out which he kept in the bucket. Then, we dialled 100 to inform the police who came to the spot and informed the forest department,\" Shivnath, another resident of the house, told India Today. \"Snakes have been kept in a bucket with milk. But we fear that more reptiles might still be lurking within the kutcha house, potentially posing a threat to anyone who comes across them,\" he added.

      "text": "An auto driver was beaten and hacked to death by a group of youths busy cutting a birthday cake on a road in Chennai’s Ambattur area after he allegedly honked at them, reports said on Saturday. At least eight people, including two juveniles, were arrested in connection with the incident that took place on Thursday, according to the Times of India. The victim, identified as 25-year-old Kamesh from Venkateswara Nagar in Ambattur, was driving his friend’s autorickshaw at the time of the incident. According to eyewitnesses, the auto driver had confronted the gang of men and asked them to clear the way, moments before he was killed. Kamesh’s brother, Sathish, aged 29, was also injured in the attack. As per the police account, on Thursday night, Kamesh was driving with his brother from Ambattur to Oragadam to drop him home around 11.30 pm. Meanwhile, a gang of ten men was celebrating a birthday on Ayyappan Street junction, causing a roadblock. Due to the narrow road, Kamesh honked, which irked the gang and led to an argument between them. The gang had insisted on Kamesh to wait until their celebrations were over. Kamesh and his brother strongly opposed the roadblock and requested the revellers to clear the way for their vehicle. The confrontation enraged Gautham, the person whose birthday was being celebrated, along with a few others who attacked Kamesh with knives. Sathish attempted to protect Kamesh and was injured. Sathish managed to alert the neighbors for help, but unfortunately, by the time they arrived, the gang had already stabbed Kamesh multiple times and fled the scene. The police were informed and quickly arrived at the location, where they confirmed Kamesh’s death. Sathish was rushed to a nearby hospital for medical treatment. The Ambattur police have filed a case of murder and apprehended Gautham, 22, Naveen Kumar, 18, Ajay, 22, Riaz, 19, Kathiresan, 19, Surya, 23, and two juveniles in connection with the incident.",

      "title": "Maldives transit point for shipments circumventing sanctions against Russia: Report",
      "text": "Male [Maldives], July 22 (ANI): Maldives is a transit point for shipments that circumvent sanctions against Russia, Nikkei Asia reported, adding that it includes shipments of US-made semiconductors to Russia. Approximately 400,000 US-made semiconductors, worth a total of USD 53.6 million, were shipped to Russia via the Maldives, in the year after Russia invaded Ukraine, as per Russian customs clearance data obtained from the Indian research firm Export Genius and analysed by Nikkei. The records analysed covered shipments valued at over USD 50,000 (approximately seven million yen) each. The Maldives was second only to China, including Hong Kong, in terms of such imports in the year after the invasion. Records for the year before the invasion covering transactions of the same minimum value show no such shipments of chips from the Maldives to Russia, according to Nikkei Asia. Data from the United Nations shows that the Maldives' total exports in 2021, excluding services, came to approximately USD 280 million. The value of US semiconductor shipments from the Maldives to Russia is equivalent to 20 per cent of this figure. Shipments of semiconductors increased sharply in May 2022, the same month that Russian airline giant Aeroflot resumed flights between Male, the capital of the Maldives, and Moscow. The flights had been suspended due to the invasion of Ukraine that February. According to senior consulting director at Omdia, Akira Minamikawa, this sudden increase came despite the fact that the Maldives semiconductor market is nonexistent. Going by customs data, 14 exporters sent semiconductors from the Maldives to Russia. None of those companies appeared to be based in the Maldives. Furher according to Nikkei Asia, one such company, the London-headquartered Mykines Corp, exported approximately USD 40 million worth of chips, or 80 per cent of the total shipments revealed in the Nikkei analysis. The No. 2 company on the list was Hong Kong-based Pixel Devices. Pixel in an email to Nikkei acknowledged that it exports to Russian companies but said it \"strictly adheres to the export control laws applicable to Hong Kong entities\" and \"deemed not to violate any applicable regulations.\"The company declined to comment on questions relating to potential sanctions violations against Russia or about the Maldives. Key to such shipments is freight forwarders or intermediaries that connect shippers and transporters and handle customs procedures on their behalf, according to Nikkei Asia. (ANI)",

On the other hand, in the men's event, Kishore Jena achieved a distance of 78.96m to clinch the gold medal. He failed to get past his personal best distance of 82.87, which he achieved in Bhubaneshwar last month. Tokyo 2020 Olympian Shivpal Singh won the silver with a 73.34m throw.

      "text": "The death toll due to a landslide in India’s western state of Maharashtra has increased to 22 as efforts to rescue potentially dozens of people still trapped under the debris continue. The landslide struck on Thursday with local reports suggesting a number of the 50 houses in the village of Irshalwadi were flattened under mud. Six more bodies were pulled out from underneath layers of mud on Friday, increasing the toll due to the incident to 22. The village is home to at least 225 people, and while about 80 of them have managed to escape, more than 100 people were unaccounted for according to local reports. The landslide struck early in the morning when many of those affected were asleep. Rescue operations have been hindered by incessant rainfall, poor visibility, and the hilly terrain. These conditions have made the movement of heavy machinery to the site impossible, slowing down the work, Reuters reported citing officials. There are also fears of more landslides in the region as the heavy rainfall continues, especially of a fort located at a higher altitude. “The foundations of the fort have been weakened by the rain and the landslide, so we are also keeping a watch on that while we work to ensure more lives are not lost in case of another incident,” Atul Karwal, the director general of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) told Reuters. Maharashtra Chief minister Eknath Shinde announced compensation payments of Rs 500,000 (£4,700) to the families of those who died in the landslide. The Indian Meteorological Department has announced a red alert for the western Indian states of Maharashtra, Goa, and Gujarat with heavy to very heavy rainfall likely on Sunday. Record rainfall in northern India has led to over 100 deaths, with roads caving in and homes collapsing in the last two weeks.",

      "title": "‘Barbenheimer’ frenzy hits North American cinemas – The Frontier Post",
      "text": "NEW YORK (AFP): Dolls in neon pink dreamhouses, scientists at Los Alamos, or both? “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” hit North American movie theaters on Friday, in what is expected to be among Hollywood’s biggest weekends of the year – inspiring a frenzy for the diametrically opposed films. But as fans of the iconic toy and history buffs interested in the father of the atomic bomb flocked to cinemas, actors and writers remained on strike, casting a pall over the outlook for the film industry. For now, both movies are off to strong starts with the cotton candy-hued “Barbie” bringing in $22.3 million from previews and “Oppenheimer” $10.5 million, said Daniel Loria, editorial director at Boxoffice Pro. For the weekend, “Barbie” could take in $150 million, according to estimates, exceeding December’s opening of “Avatar: The Way of Water.” “The expectations are just so big that we’re trying to figure out not if it’s going to be a success, but how big of a success it’s going to be,” Loria said. Millions of moviegoers are set to see both films through Sunday, with more than 200,000 planning to catch both in the same day, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners. Excitement over the parallel opening – a phenomenon dubbed “Barbenheimer” – has sparked memes featuring frantic transitions between viewing both movies and moviegoers showing up at theaters in outrageous outfits. ‘Funny juxtaposition’ The online buzz surrounding same-day viewings drew salesman Eric Adams, 27, to the cinema in New York on Friday. “I just wanted to be in on it and the theater was full at 10:30 in the morning, so that was pretty crazy,” he told AFP. He added that he had trouble finding tickets to “Barbie” and settled for a late screening. Another moviegoer, 23-year-old actor Dara Weinstein, added: “Because it’s such a funny juxtaposition that those two movies are coming out on the same day, it definitely created a lot of buzz around them.” Viewers finally have “a weekend of choice,” said Loria of the parallel opening, which adds to hits like the latest installment of the “Mission Impossible” franchise and “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.” For a multiplex model to work for theater owners, such diversity in films is needed, he said. Colorado-based Emma McNealy, 35, said she would typically have waited to stream “Oppenheimer” at home, given its three-hour runtime and serious subject matter. But chatter online about people planning to see both on the same day intrigued the account manager. On “Barbie,” she said: “I think a lot of women like that a Barbie is getting more layers in this telling; it’s not just candy-coated fluff.” Cross-promotion The excitement around recent movie releases has also seen celebrities promote each others’ films. Although director Christopher McQuarrie’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” opened around a week before “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” actor Tom Cruise earlier tweeted about looking forward to both films. In turn, “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig and star Margot Robbie showed photos of themselves posing with tickets for the “Mission Impossible” movie. “The movie industry has a very healthy record of accommodating two big pictures,” said David Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research. “The studios are very experienced and they don’t step on each other,” he added, noting that both movies generally attract different audiences. “Oppenheimer would be more male-oriented and older, and Barbie will be more female-oriented and younger,” Gross told AFP. “But I think everybody is going to both, and it’s a fit.”",

      "text": "Monitoring Desk MUMBAI: Veteran Bollywood actress Taapsee Pannu launched her Non-Fungible Token (Nft) platform, which will distinguish faceless trollers from her dedicated fans. Taapsee Pannu’s NFT platform “taapseeclub.com” will make her fans explore her life and positively elevate their fandom. Moreover, her admirers will be able to interact, celebrate moments and experience being on the film sets with the ‘Pink‘ star. The Bollywood actress said separating the content celebrities share with those genuinely interested in actors and supportive of their endeavours is necessary in today’s cluttered world. She lined up several events. They fans will get to celebrate her birthday, with her and other stars like Abish Mathew, Angad Ranyal and Gurleen Pannu. Taapsee Pannu said she is giving an opportunity for the fans to know her more personally through the NFT platform. “I have decided to launch NFTs exclusively for genuine individuals, providing them with an opportunity to get to know me on a more personal level. I aim to present a distinct social media experience for my NFT members, one that differs from my public presence,” she said. The actress added, “As an extrovert who enjoys interacting with people, I find social media to be too toxic for expressing my true self. It is always beneficial to have a close-knit community of individuals who genuinely wish the best for you and contribute to personal growth.”",

      "text": "Conservative groups nationwide have pushed to ban books that discuss L.G.B.T.Q. issues from libraries and schools, saying that parents should be able to control what their children are being taught. The San Diego residents who sent the email to the Rancho Peñasquitos Library, Amy M. Vance and Martha Martin, did not respond to requests for comment. City officials said they have not heard since from the library patrons. The text of their email was identical to a template posted online by a right-wing group called CatholicVote, which has an office in Indiana and is not affiliated with the Catholic church. The group has promoted a “Hide the Pride” campaign that encourages supporters to check out or move books that depict L.G.B.T.Q. characters and families. Organizers have described such material as pornographic and obscene and said it should not be available to young library patrons. “The library needs to use its discretion in how it will make certain content available to people who have very different beliefs about whether this is appropriate for kids,” said Brian Burch, the president of CatholicVote. Among the books on the group’s target list are “Julián Is a Mermaid,” a picture book about a little boy whose grandmother takes him to a mermaid parade at Coney Island, and “Morris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress,” another picture book about a boy who loves using his imagination and wearing an orange dress to school. Both were checked out by the protesters in San Diego.",

The landslide occurred on Thursday night in the remote mountain hamlet of Irshalwadi, about 60 kilometres from Mumbai, flattening several houses. The hamlet is estimated to have been home to at least 225 people, more than 80 of whom managed to escape. The Times of India newspaper reported on Saturday that around 80 people were still missing.

Visuals from news channels showed rescue teams, wearing bright orange raincoats and carrying digging tools, trekking up the mountain to the site of the landslide.

      "text": "Maguire sisters excited for the Australia challenge July 22nd 2023 by Craig Easdown | International, Women The sisters play their club cricket for The Hills Cricket Club and for the Scorchers in the Evoke Super Series. Earlier this year, older sister Jane was forced to withdraw from the Caribbean tour with her place taken in the squad by younger sister Aimee. Jane Maguire, 20, made her international debut in 2021 and has 25 caps to date across the white-ball formats. Aimee Maguire, 16, made her international debut earlier this month in St Lucia and played four matches against the West Indies on that tour. Speaking ahead of the series, Jane Maguire said: “It’s great to be back after fully recovering from my injury and really eager to get going with the series. Preparations have been going well - the girls had a few days off after the West Indies trip, but we are all back now and have been working hard and looking forward to get going as a unit.” Asked about her international cricket journey to date, she said: “Getting to play with the best in Ireland and against the best in the world means you can constantly learn something new every series or tour. Everyone has different knowledge to share and different skills to demonstrate, and being able to chat to opposition players and hear about their experiences is incredibly rewarding. “I still have to admit that I’m a little surprised with the opportunities that has sport has given me. I joined cricket as a kid to have fun and make friends – now, I am so grateful to be able to travel the world with my friends playing a sport I love. “In terms of my best day so far, I’d have to say the World Cup qualifiers semi-final against Zimbabwe would have to be up there. The excitement of knowing that we qualified and were going to a World Cup was a special moment.” As part of the team that beat Australia in a warm-up match earlier this year at the T20 World Cup, she said: “While it was a warm-up, it’s not every day you can say we beat the best team in the world. We had a lot of positives in that game, so if we play the way we want to play you never know what results may happen in this series.” Despite missing the tour with an injury, Jane was in St Lucia on the day her sister Aimee made her debut - how proud a moment was that for Jane and her family? “It was such a proud moment for the whole family, it’s always exciting to present a debutant with their cap, but even more special that it was my sister! I’m very grateful that I was able to be there to give it to her.” Aimee Maguire was also speaking ahead of the seres: “Making my international debut was definitely an exciting time, and to receive my debut cap from Jane definitely meant a lot. I have always looked up to her as my big sister and I wouldn’t have asked for a better person to present me with my first cap “As for the Caribbean tour, I had an opportunity to train and play like a professional athlete for three weeks which I really enjoyed. I took a lot of inspiration from playing against some of the best players in the world like Hayley Matthews.” About her pathway into cricket, she said: “I started playing cricket at the age of 5. I grew up around the club watching my dad and sisters play. I just suddenly got thrown onto the field when Jane’s team were short players one day – and loved it. I wasn’t always a spinner, though, I use to be a seam bowler until about 18 months ago. I started bowling spin in January 2022 - I definitely did not imagine myself being a spin bowler, but definitely happy I have now changed.” And about the series ahead? “It’s definitely exiting to be a part of the series, as it’s not everyday day that you get to play against Australia and it’s exciting to be playing in my first home series with all my family and friends here to support. But above all, I’m definitely looking forward to hopefully getting to play with Jane for the first time internationally. That would be incredible.” THE SERIES The first match is already sold out with the third match close to sell out as well.

      "title": "CJI cautions against misusing tech, social media, and AI for harmful purposes; says human values and justice matter",
      "text": "Technology, especially one fostering quicker communication to a larger spectrum of audiences such as social media, and artificial intelligence (AI) which has permeated all sectors, should create affordances against misuse because human values and individual privacy are of paramount importance, Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud said here on Saturday. Contending that \"new technology cannot exist in a vacuum\" and hence has to be made benign with safeguards for affable use, the CJI said technology should facilitate reliable use without causing any trepidation among the people about the possible breach of their personal liberty. \"Social media has allowed us to connect with people, removing barriers of age and nationality. But this new communication tool has led to new behaviour like online abuse and trolling. Likewise, AI contains the potential for misuse, mislead, threaten, or even bully individuals. Curbing its misuse for harmful purposes will be among the key challenges for you,\" he said addressing the graduating students at the 60th convocation of IIT Madras. Technology should not create fear in the minds of users through online abuse or harassment. An impact of AI recruitment tools is that it appeared to show discrimination or bias, he claimed. \"Today, I want to leave you with two questions that I hope you will ask yourselves. What are the value your technology represents and what are its affordances?\" Justice Chandrachud asked. \"When I say value, I do not mean the monetary worth of your ideas, innovations, or technology. I mean what principled values the technology represents and in particular, what are the values it furthers in the context you seek to deploy it,\" he said. \"Keep in mind what values a particular AI represents and what affordances it creates,\" the CJI said. Emphasising how technology could be put to good use, he said during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Supreme Court held 43 million virtual hearings and courts across the country too held similar virtual hearings to facilitate the lawyers and litigants to appear before the courts for disposal of cases, and thus paved the way for \"inclusivity and access to justice,\" he said. Another instance was to conduct \"tele law\" facility which benefitted in providing legal services to the people, particularly women and children. Going a step further, the apex court has now launched AI system for transcription of live proceedings on an experimental basis, the CJI said. He said no technology can be neutral if deployed in a real-world context. Technological use has to fulfil and represent some human values. \"Therefore values matter. Science and technology can empower us to secure our liberty, equality, and social justice,\" he said and added that our Constitution laid down the basis for rights and liberties for growth. A total of 2,571 students graduated during the 60th convocation and 453 doctorate degrees including 19 for joint degrees with foreign universities received their degree certificates. IIT Madras has become the first institute in the country to establish its international campus in Zanzibar (Tanzania) for four-year MS and two-year BS courses in data science and AI, said IIT-M Director V Kamakoti. Pawan Goenka, chairperson, Board of Governors, IIT Madras, said the institute's spending on research activities increased to Rs 1,000 crore now from about Rs 250 crore in the past.",

      "text": "Besides being regarded as one of the most beloved on-screen pairs of all time, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol also enjoy a remarkably strong bond in their personal lives. Whenever they appear together, they never fail to bring joy to the audience by seizing every chance to playfully tease each other or express their affection openly. Though Abbas–Mustan's Baazigar is the first film they did together, it is Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge that holds a unique place in the hearts of movie enthusiasts. The film also stands out as an immensely celebrated romantic masterpiece in the history of Indian cinema. Nevertheless, the filming of DDLJ posed its challenges, even with Yash Chopra as the producer, as the lead actors found it difficult to maintain composure and would often break into laughter at unexpected moments. During an earlier interview, both SRK and Kajol spoke candidly about the extensive efforts it took to film a brief scene in DDLJ, revealing that it required more than 17 takes and three camera magazines. The scene being referred to here is the one where Simran (Kajol) wakes up after a drunken evening in Raj’s (SRK) bed. To trick her into believing they spent the night together, Raj shows her some lipstick marks on his chest. \"Right from the beginning of filming that scene, we found it incredibly funny. Surprisingly, when we attempted to film it seriously, it became even more comical. Adding to the hilarity, the shirt I wore had a zipper that made a strange sound whenever I opened it, making us burst into laughter even more. Though similar incidents occurred during other scenes too, this one was exceptionally funny,\" Shah Rukh Khan told NDTV. Kajol, on the other hand, clarified that there was nothing technically wrong with the zipper and that they simply found it \"unnecessarily funny\". \"It took us three magazines to shoot that scene. Adi was so angry,\" she added. Shah Rukh revealed even Yash Chopra got upset and \"started shouting\". He said that even today if one looks closely, one can see him and Kajol smiling a bit through their eyes. DDLJ marked the directorial debut of Aditya Chopra, son of veteran filmmaker Yash Chopra, known as the King of Romance in Hindi cinema. The 1995 film, also starring the late Amrish Puri, Farida Jalal and Anupam Kher, released at a time when India had opened up to liberalisation.",

You can imagine what would have happened if there would have been a Congress government in the violence-hit state,\" Gehlot said.ALSO READ | 'India will not stay silent while...', tweets Rahul Gandhi on Manipur violence\"PM Modi's first comment on the Manipur violence came amid his visits to poll-bound states and foreign countries, which raised concerns among the people of Rajasthan,\" the senior Congress leader expressed.In his initial response to the shocking incident of Manipur women being paraded naked before being raped, PM Modi had called it a \"shameful incident for any society\" and urged all chief ministers to strengthen law and order in their respective states.The prime minister emphasised that the issue of a woman's honor should transcend politics, regardless of whether it's in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, or Manipur.Responding to PM Modi's remark, Ashok Gehlot said the BJP was afraid due to the Congress government's performance in Rajasthan, hence it was engaging in spreading rumours.\"The prime minister will come to poll-bound Rajasthan on July 27. He will again indulge in marketing. No one can do marketing the way Modi does,\" he said.ALSO READ | Manipur horrific video: 4 arrests, Chief Minister assures exemplary actionFurthermore, Ashok Gehlot also highlighted Manipur CM N Biren Singh's acknowledgment of the numerous incidents in the state.\"An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 FIRs have been registered in Manipur. There have been sporadic incidents in Rajasthan but that cannot be compared to Manipur,” he said.Over 150 people have lost their lives, and many others have been injured since the outbreak of ethnic violence on May 3 during a 'Tribal Solidarity March' protesting against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur's population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley, while tribals, which include Nagas and Kukis, constitute 40 per cent and reside mostly in the hill districts.ALSO READ | Priyanka Chopra, Jaya Bachchan and Celina Jaitley condemn Manipur violence, demand urgent action--- ENDS",

      "text": "MUMBAI: The death toll from a landslide in India's western state of Maharashtra rose to 26 on Saturday (Jul 22), a disaster relief official said, with dozens still feared trapped under layers of mud and slush two days after the incident. The landslide occurred on Thursday night in the remote mountain hamlet of Irshalwadi, about 60km from Mumbai, flattening several houses. The hamlet is estimated to have been home to at least 225 people, more than 80 of whom managed to escape. The Times of India newspaper reported on Saturday that around 80 people were still missing. \"We are working on our technical equipment, our rescue techniques,\" S.B. Singh, an official with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), told Reuters. \"We cannot judge as of now how many people are still stuck,\" Singh said, adding that four more bodies were pulled out from underneath the mud on Saturday. Visuals from news channels showed rescue teams, wearing bright orange raincoats and carrying digging tools, trekking up the mountain to the site of the landslide. Rescue operations are being hindered by incessant rainfall, poor visibility, and the hilly terrain, Singh added. There were about 16-17 houses affected by the landslide and many families have been relocated, the official added.",

      "text": "If like any other person in India, you have noticed a rise in spam calls of late, there might be a way to fight them now. Truecaller, the popular caller ID and spam-blocking app, has launched its AI-based call screening feature in India. The feature, which was first introduced in September 2022 in select countries, allows users to let an AI assistant answer and transcribe incoming calls for them. The Truecaller Assistant uses speech-to-text technology and natural language processing to interact with callers and display real-time details about the call on the user's screen. It can answer and converse with the caller using its smart algorithm and show you the transcription on your screen. You can also guide the assistant with quick taps on predefined responses. When you are busy, you can set up your own personalised greetings for the assistant to use. You can choose from different voices and languages for the assistant, including over 100 options like Hindi and other regional languages. The call screening feature is aimed at helping users avoid spam calls and save time by knowing the caller's intent and purpose before picking up the phone. Truecaller also says that the feature will enhance the user's security and privacy. The feature is currently available only for Android users in India, and can be used for free for 14 days. After that, users will have to subscribe to the Truecaller Premium Assistant plan, which costs Rs 99 for the first month and Rs 149 per month thereafter. There is no word on when the feature will be rolled out to iOS users. You can access AI call screening right from the bottom navigation bar - there's a new button marked 'Assistant' from where it can be enabled.",

      "title": "CJI Cautions Against Misusing Tech, Social Media, and AI for Harmful Purposes; Says Human Values and Justic",
      "text": "Technology, especially one fostering quicker communication to a larger spectrum of audiences such as social media, and artificial intelligence (AI) which has permeated all sectors, should create affordances against misuse because human values and individual privacy are of paramount importance, Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud said here on Saturday. Contending that “new technology cannot exist in a vacuum” and hence has to be made benign with safeguards for affable use, the CJI said technology should facilitate reliable use without causing any trepidation among the people about the possible breach of their personal liberty. “Social media has allowed us to connect with people, removing barriers of age and nationality. But this new communication tool has led to new behaviour like online abuse and trolling. Likewise, AI contains the potential for misuse, mislead, threaten, or even bully individuals. Curbing its misuse for harmful purposes will be among the key challenges for you,” he said addressing the graduating students at the 60th convocation of IIT Madras. Technology should not create fear in the minds of users through online abuse or harassment. An impact of AI recruitment tools is that it appeared to show discrimination or bias, he claimed. “When I say value, I do not mean the monetary worth of your ideas, innovations, or technology. I mean what principled values the technology represents and in particular, what are the values it furthers in the context you seek to deploy it,” he said. “Keep in mind what values a particular AI represents and what affordances it creates,” the CJI said. Emphasising how technology could be put to good use, he said during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Supreme Court held 43 million virtual hearings and courts across the country too held similar virtual hearings to facilitate the lawyers and litigants to appear before the courts for disposal of cases, and thus paved the way for “inclusivity and access to justice,” he said. Another instance was to conduct “tele law” facility which benefitted in providing legal services to the people, particularly women and children. Going a step further, the apex court has now launched AI system for transcription of live proceedings on an experimental basis, the CJI said. He said no technology can be neutral if deployed in a real-world context. Technological use has to fulfil and represent some human values. “Therefore values matter. Science and technology can empower us to secure our liberty, equality, and social justice,” he said and added that our Constitution laid down the basis for rights and liberties for growth. A total of 2,571 students graduated during the 60th convocation and 453 doctorate degrees including 19 for joint degrees with foreign universities received their degree certificates. IIT Madras has become the first institute in the country to establish its international campus in Zanzibar (Tanzania) for four-year MS and two-year BS courses in data science and AI, said IIT-M Director V Kamakoti. Pawan Goenka, chairperson, Board of Governors, IIT Madras, said the institute’s spending on research activities increased to Rs 1,000 crore now from about Rs 250 crore in the past.",

      "title": "Massive protests take place against mob assaults on women in India's remote northeastern state",
      "text": "Thousands of people, mostly women, held a massive sit-in in India’s violence-wracked northeastern state of Manipur on Saturday demanding the immediate arrest of those involved in the harrowing mob assaults on two women who were paraded naked. Religious and women organization leaders addressed nearly 15,000 protesters who also called for the sacking of Biren Singh, the top elected official in the state where more than 130 people have been killed since violence between two dominant ethnic groups erupted in early May. The protest was held in Churachandpur, a town 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Imphal, the state capital. A video showing the assaults on women triggered massive outrage and was widely shared on social media late Wednesday despite the internet being largely blocked and journalists locked out of the remote state. The footage shows the two naked women surrounded by scores of young men who grope their genitals and drag them to a field. Police said the assault occurred May 4, a day after the violence started. According to a police complaint filed on May 18, the two women were part of a family attacked by a mob that killed its two male members. The complaint alleges rape and murder by “unknown miscreants.” The state government on Saturday announced the arrest of a fifth suspects. Rajiv Singh, the state’s director-general of police, said police were carrying out raids to arrest other suspects. Manipur has been the scene of a near-civil war that was sparked when Christian Kukis protested a demand by the mostly Hindu Meiteis for a special status that would let them buy land in the hills populated by Kukis and other tribal groups, as well as a guaranteed share of government jobs. Clashes have persisted despite the army’s presence in Manipur, a state of 3.2 million people tucked in the mountains on India’s border with Myanmar that is now divided into two ethnic zones. More than 60,000 people have fled to packed relief camps. Nearly 400 men and women also held a protest in the Indian capital with the similar demands. They carried placards reading “We demand action against the perpetrators” and ”Resign, Biren Singh.” In Manipur state, the protesters assembled at a \"Wall of Remembrance” site in an open ground in Churachandpur, a stronghold of the Kuki tribe, where they kept dummy coffins of people of their minority community killed in the violence. Ngaineikim, the chairperson of the Kuki Women Organization for Human Rights, accused Singh, who belongs to the majority Meiti community, of orchestrating atrocities then expressing sympathy with the victims. Singh did not comment immediately but on Thursday said that an investigation was underway to ensure \"strict action is taken against all the perpetrators, including considering the possibility of capital punishment. Let it be known, there is absolutely no place for such heinous acts in our society.”",

      "title": "India to become global hub for green hydrogen Modi",
      "text": "Speaking at the G20 energy ministers? meeting in Goa, the Indian prime minister shared his government's energy transition plans Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said India is ramping up its efforts to ensure sustainable growth during its energy transition, replacing fossil fuels with renewables and becoming a hub for so-called green hydrogen, generated from wind, water and solar power. \"We achieved our non-fossil, installed electric capacity target nine years in advance. We have now set a higher target, we plan to achieve 50% non-fossil installed capacity by 2030\", he told the G20 energy ministers' meeting in Goa. Prime Minister Modi noted that India is among the global leaders in solar and wind power. In 2021, the country committed to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070. Modi went on to outline India's efforts in developing technology and infrastructure for the energy transition. \"For decarbonising India we are working on a mission of green hydrogen alternative\", he said. \"That aim is to make India a global hub of production and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives. We are happy to share our learnings.\" India's National Green Hydrogen Mission was unveiled by the Modi government in 2022 with a target of producing 5 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030 and securing a 10% market share of the global hydrogen trade. Earlier this year, New Delhi approved a nearly 175 billion-rupee ($2.1 billion) program to incentivise green hydrogen fuel producers, covering at least 10% of their costs. New Delhi is also considering bilateral agreements with several countries to trade green hydrogen. Power Ministry officials told the media last week India and Japan will be discussing setting up a joint credit mechanism to enable buyers of green hydrogen to receive carbon emission credits generated from the production of green hydrogen. Addressing the G20 via a video link, Modi also stressed the need to support countries of the 'Global South' in their efforts to secure economic growth while reducing their carbon footprints. \"The world looks up to this group [G20] to advance a sustainable, just, affordable, inclusive and clean energy transition, and while doing this it's important that our brothers and sisters in the Global South are not left behind,\" he said, urging the grouping to ensure low-cost financing for developing countries, and to find ways to bridge technology gaps for energy security. Modi also highlighted, among other government initiatives targeting green growth, that India has rolled out a cleaner-burning version of petrol, dubbed E20, or petrol blended with 20% ethanol, and the aim is to have special fuel stations retailing E20 fuel across the country by 2025. The 14th Clean Energy Ministerial and 8th Mission Innovation Meeting kicked off in Goa on Friday under the chairmanship of R. K. Singh, India's Minister for Power and New and Renewable Energy, and with the participation of ministers of more than 30 countries. Addressing the meeting, Singh said that while India's per-capita carbon emissions are much lower than the world average - around 2.29 tons against 6.3 tons globally - the country has focused on cutting fossil fuel consumption and increasing renewable energy generation. \"We have set targets to meet 50% of our energy requirements from non-fossil sources by the year 2030. India will achieve more than its target of generating 500 GW renewable energy by 2030,\" he pledged. (RT.com)",

What should we eat and what should we not is a factor that determines our health and vice-versa. When embarking on the weight loss routine, diet plays an important role (of course). We all have heard how eating things together can be harmful for the body while some food combos can be equally healthy. 5 HEALTHY FOOD COMBOS FOR WEIGHT LOSS Oatmeal and Nuts: Adding more fiber to the diet can help with digestion and speed up the metabolic process. Simply adding more fibre to your diet can lead to weight loss. That’s because your body can’t break down fibre, so it slows down digestion and takes up space in your stomach. With 4 grams of fiber per cup, oatmeal can be a good source. Walnuts can add about another 2 grams, plus satisfying protein and crunch. Avocados and Leafy Greens: Green veggies have always been a compulsory healthy food recommended in a balanced diet. Avocados are high in anti-oxidants that save the body from oxidative stress. Eggs and bell peppers: You will quickly be able to fit into your tight pants thanks to this potent fat-frying pair. Choline, a substance that speeds up the metabolism, is found in eggs, while peppers are an excellent source of vitamin C. Getting enough of the nutrient can aid in the battle against cortisol, a hormone that promotes the buildup of belly fat. You can cut a pepper in half and empty it. Break an egg inside and bake till cooked. Season and enjoy this quick snack. Green tea and lemon: Tea is a miraculous beverage that has been shown to help you lose weight and burn abdominal fat. The fat-burning antioxidant ECGC is particularly abundant in green tea. Additionally, it contains a lot of catechins, another antioxidant that helps your liver convert fat into energy and can encourage the release of fat from fat cells. Green tea, which has pectin and polyphenols, which have both been shown to help individuals feel fuller and lose weight, is made better by adding a squeeze of lemon to it. Chicken and Vegetables: Chicken is a good source of protein and healthy fats. During the weight loss regime, we have to let go off certain foods and there is a change in diet plan. For the body to recover and have enough nutrients, chicken serves as a good source. A combo with vegetables only adds to the table of nutrients, While this is just generic information about some of the food combos to swap with, it may not work equally well for everyone. Weight loss requirements differ from person to person and it is best to consult a dietician or nutritionist or a professional to chart out a meal plan for weight loss.

      "title": "Wet socks can make a difference: Tips from readers on keeping cool without AC",
      "text": "How do you stay cool without an air conditioner in a year of record-breaking heat? Last week we featured a story by heatwave researcher Dr. Gulrez Shah Azhar about how he dealt with brutally high temps while growing up in India with no A/C. And we asked NPR readers to share their tips. Here's a selection of reader responses, edited for length and clarity. And we also asked Azhar to offer his take on their advice – as well as to share additional insights. Watch what you eat! Colette Parry, Boston, Mass.: When I was growing up in Portland, Oregon, we never cooked during the day in the summer. We ate a lot of no-cook meals like corn and bean salad (recipe: can of black beans, a bag of frozen corn, a chopped red pepper or other veg and seasoning/dressing to taste). Anything that required cooking, we did at night and then either ate it cold during the day or heated up in the microwave. Haha, this is so clever – simple and so ingenious. I am all for it! Meg T., Portland, Maine: Something I learned while visiting India was to eat plenty of cooling foods like watermelon and cucumber. On super hot days I will switch to mostly those foods and it makes an incredible difference in the temperature of my body and the ability to deal with the heat. Azhar: Yes, foods with lots of fluids and electrolytes are super helpful in keeping one cool and hydrated. I would also add yogurt-based drinks like raita and chhas (buttermilk) to this list. Anthea Peck, Sebastopol, Calif.: As a kid from Georgia growing up in India, I have SO many memories of the heat. I remember getting heat exhaustion when I was 10 after riding a horse in the early morning. I remember my father (who worked for the World Health Organization) giving me U.N. oral rehydration packets to carry around. My school told us to carry salt packets. Azhar: Oh yes, this is so smart. Either an ORS pack or simply mix a spoon of sugar and a pinch of salt in a glass of water to replenish all the electrolytes lost in sweat. Water yourself Laurisa Rich, Martha's Vineyard, Mass.: When I lived in the tropics, I found it ever so helpful to keep my hair wet and dripping. The evaporative action on the head and shoulders is so refreshing and helps to stay cool. Yes, this is one of those under-appreciated but cool ways of staying cool! But be careful and avoid hard water as it may harm your hair. Jeff Weit, Atascadero, Calif.: Growing up near East Los Angeles we were too far from the ocean to receive any of its cooling effects, so we relied on my mom for ways to cool down in the hot summers. For instance, we'd use our daytime water guns, aka our mom's Amway squirt bottles, to spray ourselves as we lay in bed while my brother and I fought over how to direct the box fan for bedtime. In India it would most likely be a table fan or a pedestal fan. For playing with water we would use squirt bottles to spray water. In fact, the onset of summer is celebrated with a festival called \"Holi\" where we spray colors - both dry and wet (using water balloons and water bottles). Sleep smart — and cool Scott Taylor, Lawrence, Kan.: When we lived in southern Arizona, some of the older houses had an \"Arizona room.\" I asked a native Arizonan about these projecting, three-sided screened porches. He explained that before they had air conditioning, families would sleep there. Being open to the breeze on three sides, it was much cooler than the main house with just the windows open. Azhar: A terrific idea. It is such a nice way to stay cool. L. Chunn, Prescott, Ariz.: I grew up in Monrovia, a suburb of Los Angeles, without air conditioning, and my sister and I had a couple of favorite solutions to keep cool on hot summer days in the 1950s. August and September were always unbearably hot. We took advantage of a cement floor that had been tiled over in a large room. We would strip down to our underwear, grab a good book and a pillow and lie down on the cold floor. It never disappointed! When the spot we had chosen became too warm from the heat of our bodies, we would just roll over to another spot. Many a delightful book was read that way, although if we tried that today, we'd never be able to get back up again! I too remember sleeping on the cemented roof after spraying water on it. The evaporating water cools off the roof, and we would spread out white / light colored sheets and lie on them at night. The sheets were important so we could see any insects crawling around (never found one - i think they too were exhausted after the day in the sun). Kevin Webb, Cave Creek, Ariz.: A friend who grew up in Phoenix in the 1960's-70's and didn't have AC had a variation on the hacks you mentioned for sleeping. He slept on a cot in the backyard at night, and his mom would put a wet sheet, just normal bed linens, over him. Evaporative cooling made sleeping possible. Azhar: Older homes were built around a central courtyard or veranda. That's where people would sleep at night in the summer. Elders would keep a flashlight, a transistor radio, a stick and a whistle close by. And then sometimes there would be a chowkidar (guard) walking at night loudly shouting a supposedly reassuring phrase — jaagte raho (keep awake). And I would wonder about his choice of words: Why should I keep awake if this fellow is walking around at night to protect us?! Ice packs are your pals Anne James, San Leandro, Calif.: I live in an older home without air conditioning. One thing I do is keep ice packs in my freezer.About 30 minutes before bed I place them between the sheets to cool off the mattress, which often gets very warm. Depending on how hot it is I may lay on the ice packs as well. Cool! Lisa Downey, Lahaina, Hawaii: Another tip (looking at you menopausal sisters) is to use a gel pack from the freezer, wrapped in a cotton tea towel, under your neck — and perhaps a second gel pack on your chest at bedtime. Placing your wrists on the gel pack can also help cool down those hot flashes. Cotton tea towels work well for wrapping as the natural fibers won't make you feel hotter as synthetic materials do. You can wrap the gel pack with one, two or even three layers, depending on how cold you want it. This sounds so cool! I should try this. Jackie Bencke, Kumamoto, Japan: You know those little packs of gel/ice packs that you get to keep food cool? I freeze them and put them in a small DIY cloth cover and pin them into the armpits of a few shirts while I make my way to work in the morning. Game changer! (They sell these things in Japanese stores as thin gel \"pack\" stick-ons that adhere right to the fabric of clothing but who wants to add more plastic to the oceans?) Yes I have read about cooling vests. Homemade AC Ann Wasgatt, Roseville, Calif: I grew up in California before air conditioning. My grandmother closed all the curtains on the sunny side of the house. Then she put ice cubes in a tray and turned on a fan to blow over the tray. When I worked summers cooking the weenies and beanies at the food stand under the bleachers at the race track, it wasn't air-conditioned either, but my grandmother's old trick worked there too. That's smart! Yes, it makes so much sense to have heavy curtains drawn when it's sunny outside. Keep those wrists cool Nancy Gerhardt, Westminster, Colo.: I grew up in the south without A/C and my mom taught me to run cold water over the inside of my wrists. Yes, there's this idea of pulse or pressure points. Blood vessels in these places are so close to the skin that you can cool off your blood and body temperature by getting the area in contact with cool water. Roger Crescentini, Tampa, Fla.: I was a child in Columbus, Ga., in the late '50s. Kids like me were able to get a quick cool-down by spending 5 cents to buy a 6.5 oz. Coke and quickly putting it between our wrists. The shock of the sudden temperature change from the chilled bottle raced throughout our bodies. The technique included keeping only our wrists in contact with the cold glass to concentrate the effect. The trick was often used then and it still works now! Oh wow, never thought of that! But to avoid the temptation of those empty calories I would do this with a can of water! Sock it to me Anonymous: My daughter-in-law, who grew up in New Orleans, told me she wore wet socks to bed to keep cool on hot nights. I've tried it, and it works! Azhar: OK, I am going to do this tonight! And in conclusion .... Some closing thoughts from Azhar: Many of us believe that we can not win against the wrath of Surya the sun god in summers (when he is especially angry)! To please him some visit his temple, a UNESCO world heritage site in India's Odisha state. So we do not ever, ever take summer heat lightly. And always be prepared. One of the childhood lessons drilled into my head was to always be aware of your hydration status. And drink water even if in small sips as soon as you do any physical activity. Carrying a water bottle if going out is not just common sense but is life-saving. When feeling hot, go take a cold shower or at least periodically splash water on your face and hands and douse your head in water. Another lesson was to never go out on an empty stomach — always eat something before going out so your body has salt and electrolytes. Even if you don't feel like eating a large meal, a light snack will do the trick. Heavy physical activity — like agriculture and fieldwork — can be done during cooler parts of the day. And if possible, work in the shade, under a tree. (Thanks to our forefathers for planting them for us! And we return the favor by planting trees now even when we know we aren't going to enjoy that shade in our lifetime. Our kids will. And that's what makes a civilization!). Rabaris (a nomadic tribe in western India) and many other tribal communities use small mirrors on their clothes to reflect sunlight. The choice of color in their clothes is also ingenious. They cleverly make use of this fact that black not only takes in heat faster than white it also gives off heat much faster than white. Due to the nature of work, women frequently go in and out of their tents while men grazing livestock stay out for longer durations. Therefore to stay cool it makes sense for women to wear darker colors (these hues cool down fast as soon as women go indoors) and men to wear lighter colors (they heat up more slowly than darker colors during prolonged periods of time outdoors). Right from the British colonial times to nowadays in India, schoolchildren (like me) during English poetry classes have always wondered why English poets would expound on warm summer days. For us in the Global South, there wasn't much to be joyful about blistering, burning summers (except the mango fruit). Summer was a matter of survival, one day at a time, one hour at a time, every day. Sadly, now this seems to be true for the entire world.",

Beau Webster, Sikandar Raza and Karim Janat being top all rounders can become predicted fantasy XI team players. Because Taskin Ahmed and Mujeeb ur Rehman are experienced bowlers, they can be top picks in predicted fantasy XI team.

      "text": "India has rejected Chinese automaker BYD Co’s proposal to set up a US$1 billion factory in India in partnership with Hyderabad-based Megha Engineering and Infrastructure, India’s Economic Times reported on Saturday. “Security concerns with respect to Chinese investments in India were flagged during the deliberations,” the report quoted an Indian official as saying. Earlier this month it was reported that BYD had submitted a US$1 billion investment proposal to build electric cars and batteries in India in partnership with a local company. Will frosty India-China ties thaw as Modi, Xi look set to meet at summits? The company had said it was seeking to capture 40 per cent of India’s electric vehicle (EV) market by 2030, but its investment proposal comes at a time when India is increasing scrutiny of Chinese firms. Great Wall Motor, which planned to invest US$1 billion in India, failed in an attempt to buy a mothballed General Motors plant after it did not get government approval to close the deal. The government is also probing MG Motor India, a unit of Chinese carmaker SAIC Motor, over alleged financial irregularities. India’s Department of Commerce, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) had sought opinions from other departments on the BYD proposed venture, the report said. India’s switch to electric vehicles is lagging behind other countries such as China and the US, hampered by high upfront costs and a lack of charging infrastructure.

      "title": "Fundraising in Cork for repatriation of Indian mother who suffered a violent death",
      "text": "Fundraising efforts are under way to pay for the repatriation of an Indian mother of one who suffered a violent death at a house in Cork city earlier this month, just three months after she had made Ireland her home. Members of the Indian community in Cork have raised over €8,000 in less than 24 hours as they bid to send the remains of Deepa Dinamani (38) back to her native Kerala in southern India for burial. Deepa Dinamani (38) was found dead at her home in Cardinal Court in Wilton on the south side of Cork city on July 14th last. Regin Parithapara Rajan (41), the husband of the deceased, was charged with her murder two days later at a special sitting of Cork District Court. Fortunately the five-year-old son of Ms Dinamani was not at home when his mother died. Cork Pravasi Malayali, along with the World Malayalee Council Cork and Coinns Cork (Cork Indian nurses) are among those attempting to raise funds to assist the family of the deceased. On a donation page on idonate.ie they say that Ms Dinamani, who was a chartered accountant, travelled to Ireland for a livelihood and to support her son. “The Indian community in Cork has joined hands to support the late Ms Deepa’s family in the repatriation of the son and the deceased. As a community it is our utmost priority to send both of them together safely to India. Considering the son’s welfare it is important that he is sent back to his family in India. His caring grandparents, uncle and the extended family are eagerly awaiting his safe return to the country. “The mental wellbeing of the son is of utmost concern. His bonding with his grandparents has to be ensured as soon as possible and it is the utmost priority.” They say that Ms Dinamani, being a Hindu, would have wished her son to perform the last rites as per their religion in her home country. The three groups, along with the Cork Indian community and the Irish Malayalee, are fundraising to pay for the return of the son to his family back in India. “And to lawfully perform the last rites of his mother and also for his future.” They also want to pay for the repatriation of Ms Dinamani and costs associated with the brother of the deceased travelling to Ireland from India. Meanwhile, a candle-lit vigil was held outside the home of Ms Dinamani in Wilton last Sunday night. Some 150 people placed flowers in front of a framed picture of Ms Dinamani, which was positioned on the doorstep of her home. Ms Dinamani had worked in a Cork firm since April. In a statement Alter Domus, where Deepa had been employed as a senior funds manager, said they were “shocked and deeply saddened” by the events that took place in Cork on July 14th. “We lost a wonderful person and colleague who will be missed by many at Alter Domus. Our thoughts are with Deepa’s family at this tragic time.” The alarm was raised when Ms Dinamani failed to collect her son from the house of a friend after a summer camp. The friend went to the house where Deepa lived. The emergency services were subsequently called, and Ms Dinamani was pronounced dead at the scene. A technical examination was carried out at the scene and the property was sealed off. Regin Parithapara Rajan appeared at Cork District Court last Sunday charged with the murder of Ms Dinamani at their home in Cardinal Court in Wilton, Cork, on July 14th last. On Thursday at Cork District Court Judge Olann Kelleher further remanded Mr Rajan in custody until July 31st for DPP directions in the case.

      "text": "The High Court of Karnataka has set aside the conviction of a 46-year-old man under Section 498A (married woman subject to cruelty) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as the complaint was by his second wife rsquo; which would make the marriage null and void rsquo;.The single judge bench of Justice S Rachaiah in its judgement recently said, ldquo;Once PW.1 (complainant woman) is considered as second wife of the petitioner, obviously, the complaint filed against the petitioner for the offence under Section 498-A of IPC ought not to have been entertained.In other words, a complaint filed by the second wife against the husband and her in-laws is not maintainable. The Courts below committed error in applying the principles and also the law on this aspect. Therefore, interference by this Court in exercising the revisional jurisdiction is justified, rdquo; it said.The court was hearing a Criminal Revision Petition filed by Kantharaju, a resident of Vittavathanahalli in Tumakuru district. The complainant-woman had claimed that she was the second wife of Kantharaju and they lived together for five years and had a male child.But later she developed health issues and was affected by paralysis and became incapacitated. Kantharaju allegedly started harassing her after this point and subjected her to cruelty and mental torture. She lodged a complaint against him and the Trial Court in Tumakuru after conducting a trial found him guilty in an order on January 18, 2019.Gyanvapi Case: Varanasi Court Allows ASI To Survey Entire Premises, Except WuzukhanaThe conviction was confirmed by a Sessions Court in October 2019. Kantharaju approached the High Court with the Revision Petition in 2019. The High Court set aside the lower court order as it found that a second wife was not entitled to file a complaint under Section 498A.The prosecution has to establish that the marriage of PW.1 is legal or she is the legally wedded wife of the petitioner. Unless, it is established that she is the legally wedded wife of the petitioner, the Courts below ought to have acted upon the evidence of PWs.1 (complainant woman) and 2 (her mother) that PW.1 was the second wife, rdquo; it said.The High Court cited two judgements of the Supreme Court; Shivcharan Lal Verma case and the P Sivakumar case and said, The ratio of these two judgments of the Hon rsquo;ble Supreme Court clearly indicates that if the marriage between the husband and wife ended as null and void, the offence under Section 498A of IPC cannot be sustained.Setting aside the conviction of Kantharaju, the Court said, Admittedly, in the present case, the complainant in her evidence, PW.2 being the mother of PW.1 both have consistently deposed and admitted that, PW.1 is the second wife of the petitioner. Accordingly, the concurrent findings of the Courts below in recording the conviction requires to be set aside.",

      "title": "Massive protests take place against mob assaults on women in India's manipur",
      "text": "NEW DELHI: Thousands of people, mostly women, held a massive sit-in in India’s violence-wracked northeastern state of Manipur on Saturday (Jul 22) demanding the immediate arrest of those involved in the harrowing mob assaults on two women who were paraded naked. Religious and women organization leaders addressed nearly 15,000 protesters who also called for the sacking of Biren Singh, the top elected official in the state where more than 130 people have been killed since violence between two dominant ethnic groups erupted in early May. The protest was held in Churachandpur, a town 65km south of Imphal, the state capital. A video showing the assaults on women triggered massive outrage and was widely shared on social media late Wednesday despite the internet being largely blocked and journalists locked out of the remote state. The footage shows the two naked women surrounded by scores of young men who grope their genitals and drag them to a field. Police said the assault occurred May 4, a day after the violence started. According to a police complaint filed on May 18, the two women were part of a family attacked by a mob that killed its two male members. The complaint alleges rape and murder by “unknown miscreants.” The state government on Saturday announced the arrest of a fifth suspect. Rajiv Singh, the state’s director-general of police, said police were carrying out raids to arrest other suspects. Manipur has been the scene of a near-civil war that was sparked when Christian Kukis protested a demand by the mostly Hindu Meiteis for a special status that would let them buy land in the hills populated by Kukis and other tribal groups, as well as a guaranteed share of government jobs. Clashes have persisted despite the army’s presence in Manipur, a state of 3.2 million people tucked in the mountains on India’s border with Myanmar that is now divided into two ethnic zones. More than 60,000 people have fled to packed relief camps. Nearly 400 men and women also held a protest in the Indian capital with similar demands. They carried placards reading “We demand action against the perpetrators” and ”Resign, Biren Singh.”",

Sharmila pointed out that the internet shutdown in the region delayed the surfacing of the infamous video of sexual harassment of two women in Manipur. “The crime would have come to light sooner if there was no internet shutdown,” she said.

      "title": "Sunny Leone admits her adult entertainment career triggered mother&#8217;s alcoholism: &#8216;You want to think your mother loves you more than alcohol, but&#8230;&#8217;",
      "text": "Sunny Leone recently opened up about her mother's alcoholism, and how her decision to become an adult entertainer was a 'trigger'. Born Karenjit Kaur Vohra to an Indian Sikh family in Canada, Sunny decided to join the adult entertainment industry against her family's wishes. Her choice of profession didn't sit well with her mother, who slipped into alcoholism and passed away in 2008, much before Sunny moved to India and did Bigg Boss season five. Though she admitted that she might have triggered her mother's alcoholism, Sunny revealed that her mother had \"become an alcoholic\" way before she decided to make a career in adult films. \"She's started drinking long before that. We went through a lot of crazy in our house because of this addiction. It was sad because you always want to think that your mother loves you more than alcohol but it wasn't about that. It was that it was an addiction. It was something psychologically that needed to be repaired from the inside. It had nothing to do with me or with my brother or with my father,\" Sunny said in an appearance on Mid-Day's Sit With Hitlist series. But she agreed the \"trigger\" for her mother's alcoholism was her entry into the adult films. \"So was I a trigger? Most definitely. It didn't matter what I did, whether it was me coming home late or maybe doing something that you didn't like, it was a trigger. And then when this happened, it was the stamp trigger,\" Sunny shared. Sunny Leone came to India as a contestant on Bigg Boss season five. It was on the show that Mahesh Bhatt offered her a role in his film Jism 2. Later, she went on to star in films such as Ragini MMS 2, Ek Paheli Leela, and Mastizaade, among others. Most recently, she starred in Anurag Kashyap's Kennedy, which had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. Married to Daniel Weber, the actor is now a mother of three, twin boys Noah and Asher and a girl, Nisha whom she adopted in 2017.",

      "title": "Manipur Police makes fifth arrest in connection with parading incident - Jammu Kashmir Latest News",
      "text": "IMPHAL, July 22: Manipur Police has arrested a fifth person, aged around 19, in connection with the May 4 parading of two women naked in Kangpokpi district of the state, officials said on Saturday. The two women are alleged to have been sexually assaulted before being set free. A 26-second video of the horrific incident surfaced on Wednesday. The next day, police made the first arrest in connection with the incident. A man who was part of the mob that paraded the women at B. Phainom village and was seen dragging one of them was nabbed. Three more arrests were made later that day. These four persons were remanded in 11-day police custody on Friday. One of the women seen in the video is the wife of an ex-army man, who served as a subedar in the Assam Regiment and had even fought in the Kargil War. A complaint in connection with the video was lodged on June 21 at Saikul police station in Kangpokpi district. The FIR filed in this case, a copy of which has been accessed by PTI, revealed the tale of mayhem which occurred before the abduction of the tribal women. The FIR also claimed that one person was killed by the mob as he tried to protect his sister from being raped on May 4 before the two were paraded naked and molested in front of others. In a separate incident, a tribal woman had lodged a complaint at Saikul police station, stating that her 21-year-old daughter and her 24-year-old friend were allegedly raped by a mob at their rented house near Konung Mamang before brutally murdering them on May 4. The woman said both of them were working as caretaker at a car washing station and their bodies are yet to be recovered. Police has registered a case under various sections of Indian Penal Code including 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), 398(attempt to commit robbery), 436 (use of fire or explosives to destroy house) and 448 (house-tresspass) besides a section of Arms Act. However, no charges of gangrape or murder are levelled in the FIR. More than 160 people have lost their lives, and several have been injured since ethnic violence broke out in the state on May 3, when a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community’s demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur’s population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley, while tribals, which include Nagas and Kukis, constitute 40 per cent and reside mostly in the hill districts.

      "title": "The Republican obsession with Hunter Biden has reached a new low",
      "text": "Is Hunter Biden’s private life a public matter? Marjorie Taylor Greene is a morally bankrupt attention-seeker who seems to think her job as a congresswoman entails stirring up culture wars rather than representing her constituents. She’s become a household name thanks to her nonstop taxpayer-funded trolling. Despite the fact that the Georgia Republican has set the bar for herself somewhere below a dungeon in hell, Greene still managed to hit a new low this week. On Wednesday she turned up at the House oversight committee with a large poster board sporting a montage of photos showing a nude Hunter Biden engaged in sex acts. Where on earth did she get these? Assuming the photos are authentic and not doctored, probably from the laptop Hunter Biden famously left in a repair shop back in 2019. Greene demonstrated some restraint: there were black boxes covering genitals and the faces of the women involved. Still, the photos were graphic. They were accompanied with the caption: “Hunter recorded multiple sex tapes with a prostitute he had paid for out of his law firm’s bank account.” While Greene warned that “parental discretion is advised” before showing this imagery to the entire room – and the camera crews in it – she didn’t explain that she was going to be exhibiting porn. That left the media outlets streaming the hearing with the awkward job of blurring out the poster boards as quickly as possible. The right is obsessed with the idea that liberals want to force ideas about sexuality on to children – yet they’re the ones beaming porn into unsuspecting living rooms around the country. And, not content with showing the pictures just once, Greene also included the images in her official email newsletter, whose subscribers may very well include minors. As well as potentially violating Georgia’s revenge porn statute (which defines nudity as including “the depiction of covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state”), she might have broken federal laws that ban distributing obscene material to minors. What was the point of this – potentially illegal – stunt? Apart, of course, from humiliating Hunter Biden, and his father, the president? Ostensibly, to provide “evidence” that Hunter Biden was involved in sex trafficking and committed tax fraud by deducting payments to prostitutions as business expenses. The subject of Wednesday’s hearing, which featured two IRS whistleblowers, was whether a federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s tax crimes was unfairly lenient. The Republicans argued that Hunter, who has pleaded guilty to two counts of misdemeanor tax crimes, was treated with kid gloves during a five-year investigation into his dealings because of family connections. Democrats, meanwhile, argued the investigation, which was headed up by a Trump-appointed attorney, was extensive and thorough. Greene’s little show-and-tell, which wasn’t backed with any real evidence, added nothing of value to this discussion. Hunter Biden is a tricky subject to discuss. Republicans are obsessed with his personal life and allegations that he made millions of dollars from foreign companies by trading off his last name. They spend an inordinate amount of time and resources trying to get his many scandals front and center in the hope it’ll help bring down Joe Biden. Or, at the very least, serve as a diversion from eyebrow-raising dealings on their side of the aisle. (Like, for example, the fact that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, made between $172m and $640m in outside income while working in the White House.) By focusing too much on Hunter Biden – a private citizen who doesn’t work for the government – the liberal-leaning media risks falling into the Republican’s narrative agenda. They also risk amplifying some of the conspiracy theories and unfounded allegations that Republicans have woven into legitimate ethical concerns about Hunter’s behaviour. While these are very real concerns, some Democrats may have overcorrected when it comes to the subject of Joe Biden’s prodigal son. There are certain liberals who seem to think Hunter’s business dealings aren’t anyone’s business. He’s not in public office, one argument goes, so why should anyone care how he makes money? Whenever Hunter Biden is trending on Twitter, which is often, you’ll see a chorus of screeches of ‘WHO CARES….WHAT ABOUT JARED AND IVANKA?!’ from liberals. This sort of hyper-partisanship isn’t healthy. The normalization of nepotism (and it’s hard to argue that nepotism didn’t play into Hunter’s art career and lucrative board positions) isn’t healthy. Hunter Biden may be a private citizen, but he’s still the president’s son. Like it or not, his behaviour, and allegations that that he made money by trading on his last name, have an impact on people’s trust in government. And the way in which his behaviour is covered has an impact on people’s trust in media. He may not have a government position, but that shouldn’t shield him from scrutiny. While there are certain aspects of Hunter Biden’s past that are tricky to discuss, I’ll tell you one thing that is inordinately clear: his sex life is nobody’s business. Unless there was criminality involved, nobody needs to know anything about what Hunter does in bed. Hunter doesn’t always come off as the most sympathetic figure – but absolutely nobody deserves what Greene just put him and his loved ones through. Texas woman vomits due to trauma of testifying on impact of extreme abortion ban A group of women are suing the state of Texas, after being denied abortions despite having nonviable or life-threatening pregnancies. The lawsuit, which was filed in March by the Center for Reproductive Rights, seeks clarification on what constitutes a “medical emergency” exception in Texas’s abortion ban. On Wednesday the women gave harrowing testimony that should be required viewing for anyone involved in creation abortion-related legislation. At one point, while explaining how she was forced to give birth to a baby who died four hours later due to a fatal birth defect, a plaintiff vomited from the stress of reliving that moment. Four men arrested after women stripped naked and paraded in Manipur Wherever there is conflict, you see rape being used as a weapon of war. Manipur, a region in north-eastern India that has been involved in an ethnic conflict since May, is no exception. A video of two women being stripped naked, publicly paraded and allegedly gang raped has gone viral and sparked outrage. On Thursday arrests took place in connection with the assault. While that’s good news, it’s unlikely there would have been any consequences for the perpetrators without the viral video pressuring authorities to act. A police report was filed at the time of the incident in early May. No action was taken for more than 70 days. Sexual violence against women and children reached all-time high in Brazil in 2022 “It would be hard to present a worse scenario in relation to violence against children and adolescents than that which emerged in 2022,” a disturbing new report states. Covid-19 lockdowns and the toxic influence of the ultra-conservative Jair Bolsonaro government may be to blame. The Women’s World Cup has kicked off And, I regret to inform you, it’s already spawned sexist commentary. During a match between Australia and Ireland, an Australian commentator marveled that motherhood hadn’t blunted the competitive instincts of midfielder Katrina Gorry. Heba Saadieh has become the first Palestinian to referee a World Cup “I hope I can open this door for others, for Palestinian women referees – and men also – to be selected in the future,” Saadieh said.

      "title": "English-language Reddit falls in love with curry restaurant&#8211; Can it win our taste tester’s heart?",
      "text": "Joto Curry comes from Osaka to Tokyo, and then to our stomach. Tokyo has an amazingly dense distribution of restaurants. Step out of any moderately sized train or subway station, and you’re likely to have dozens of dining options within a five-minute walk Having so many options can actually make it harder to pick just one, though. So when he needs to narrow things down, our Japanese-language reporter Seiji Nakazawa has been scanning English-language Tokyo restaurant discussions on Reddit, to see if there’s anything the traveling and expat foodies have been talking about but he’s missed. Recently Seiji was feeling both a rumbling in his stomach and a craving for curry, which were just the conditions necessary for him to try the latest on his list of hot-topic-on-Reddit-among-foreigners restaurants: Joto Curry. Joto Curry is actually a chain based in Osaka, but with five branches in Tokyo. Seiji, otaku that he is, has actually walked past the Joto Curry in Akihabara multiple times, but he’s never stepped inside to try it out, partially because of the name. See, the “Joto” part of the chain’s name means “high-class” or “premium,” so Seiji had always just sort of assumed that Joto Curry is an expensive place to eat. Looking at the signboard outside Joto Curry’s branch near Shibuya Station, though, Seiji was surprised to learn that its prices aren’t at all unreasonable for curry rice. The standard curry rice plate costs 740 yen (US$5.35) and the most expensive item on the menu, curry rice with sukiyaki-style beef and spinach, is just 1,290 yen. Even Joto Curry’s tonkatsu (pork cutlet) curry rice, the dish many curry fans consider to be the pinnacle of the curry rice dining experience, squeezes in under 1,000 yen, at 990. It’s also the most popular item on the chain’s menu, so that’s what Seiji ordered. Rather than placing the cutlet off to one side and covering only half the plate with roux, Joto Curry puts its tonkatsu right in the center and pours curry over everything. This let Seiji get to the taste-testing immediately… …which in turn put instantly put a smile on his face. The roux has a creamy, melty texture, neither too watery nor too thick. When you pop a spoonful into your mouth, the first sensation you get is sweetness, which then progresses to spiciness as you swallow. While it doesn’t have the fiery heat of a Thai or Indian curry, Joto Curry is decidedly on the spicy side for mainstream Japanese curry, but not so much that the spice drowns out the other flavors in the roux. It’s unmistakably restaurant quality, but there’s also something about the strong flavors and filling consistency of that also reminds Seiji of a home-cooked meal. Maybe it’s that mix of restaurant-made and home-cooked qualities that makes Joto Curry special. Curry is, after all, a great comfort food, and so any plate of curry rice that can give you a home-away-from-home feeling is definitely worth eating for both travelers and locals alike.

      "text": "The police Friday arrested a 45-year-old man for allegedly stalking and molesting three schoolgirls in Mumbai, officials said. The accused, identified as Nanasaheb Kambale, a resident of Siddharth Colony in Chembur, stalked the three girls, all aged 14 years while they were returning from school on July 17, they said. The man also made obscene gestures at them so as to outrage their modesty, said the police. “One of the girls informed her parents about the incident. The parents of the girls lodged a joint complaint at the Chembur police station on Thursday,” said an officer. Kambale, driver by profession, has been booked for stalking (sections 354D) and insulting the modesty of a woman (section 509 of the Indian Penal Code) and under Section 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The police are checking if he had molested other girls as well.",

The India A vs Pakistan A match will start at 2:00 PM (Credits: Instagram) India A, led by Yash Dhull, will take on Pakistan A in the ACC Emerging Teams Men’s Asia Cup 2023 final. So far, the Indian team has been unbeatable in the tournament after wins over UAE A and Nepal A and Bangladesh in their last few matches. India will be keen to win the game against Pakistan and lift the tournament trophy. The match is scheduled for Sunday, July 23. The final clash will take place at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, with a kick-off time of 2 pm IST. In the semi-final clash against Bangladesh A, India A set an impressive target of 211 runs for their opponents to chase. The Indian spinners then got together to bundle out Bangladesh A for 160 runs. India A and Pakistan A look evenly matched. The game will once again boil down to the side that keeps their nerves.

      "title": "The True Story Of A Boy Who Loved Barbie And The Queasy Trouble They Caused Together",
      "text": "A doll! A doll! William wants a doll! Don’t be a sissy said his best friend Ed. Those lines are from the song “William’s Doll,” based on the Charlotte Zolotow and William Pène du Bois book and sung by Alan Alda and Marlo Thomas on the 1972 “Free To Be You and Me” album. Of all the songs from this groundbreaking record helping children better understand gender, race and other issues from what we today call a “woke perspective,” it is the only one whose lyrics I recall by heart. There’s a reason: Like William, I was a boy who played with dolls. “Barbie,” the new movie on the ― at times ― controversial doll has reminded me that I was a gay Barbie Boy in a heteronormative world, something I did not yet know, even if through my fascination with dolls, others did. Cue outdated psychological nonsense if you want, but at home, I lived in a largely female environment, with three sisters and an older brother with autism spectrum disorder. My father was distant, and like many fathers at the time, not often home. Together with my mother and aunt, my close role models were female, the young ones playing with Barbies. Barbie was an early agent of progress for my siblings and me. My parents were hardly role models promoting racial harmony, but after moving our family to a primarily Italian, Irish and Jewish neighborhood in suburban Freehold, New Jersey, from inner city environments in the aftermath of Newark’s riots, they believed even if there were few Black children to play with in our new neighborhood, we could still have Black dolls. Barbie and Ken had the Black neighbors we didn’t: Christie and her boyfriend Brad. This blonde plastic figurine reigned over a fantasy world where Blacks and whites played tennis together, conversing through pull strings in the back of their necks. It was also an imaginary world where a boy could, sometimes, play with a doll meant for a girl, pushing against the period’s gender boundaries. You can be in second grade and not realize why you’re different from other children as you don an apron to play house with girls and seek attention from other boys. I developed crushes on others of my gender without understanding what these feelings were. Sometimes, I communicated through the Barbie World, not fully grasping why this was bad for boys to do. I remember trying to impress a boy whose name was Brad ― and who sat on the cool side of the lunch room ― by telling him I had a doll with his name. However, rather than being rewarded with a seat next to him, I was ridiculed. The scene still plays in my head whenever I meet someone named Brad. At home, the Barbie World was where a boy could play with dolls ― until he no longer could. One day my sisters fiercely objected to me playing with Barbie and Christie. As children, we don’t always understand why a circumstance changes, but suddenly that day things were now different. It might have been a comment from a visiting friend who wasn’t used to boys playing with dolls or an ultimatum issued by my intolerant and homophobic father (though we didn’t use the latter adjective back then), who may have told my sisters I was not permitted to play with the dolls anymore. Whatever or whoever it was, my sisters had just gotten beautiful new gowns for the dolls ― white satin with pink and red tulle for Barbie and green satin with blue tulle for Christie ― and I reacted violently to them rejecting me by grabbing the dolls and tearing up the clothes. If I wasn’t allowed to play with Barbie anymore, I was going to ensure that it was no longer fun for them. For years, the ripped gowns sat in a drawer ― a reminder of both my tantrum and my transgression into a shameful desire deemed inappropriate for my gender. Everyone knows boys aren’t supposed to play with dolls ― especially Barbie. What’s wrong with you? This wasn’t the only time there was a strong reaction to my playing with dolls. Somehow (likely from an aunt who offered me unconditional love), I received the Joey Doll, the infamously anatomically correct male baby doll representing Joey Stivic from the TV show “All in the Family.” I remember bringing him swaddled in my arms to show him off to our back door neighbors. In my head, I thought, “It’s OK for a boy to play with a doll if it’s a boy too.” The neighbors were a sports-loving family full of boys who acted the way boys should act. They did not come out to look at my new doll and, instead, went so far as to lock their patio door so I could not enter. A few days after that experience ― which I still view as a traumatic incident ― I received a dump truck as a gift. Even as a child I knew it was meant to steer me towards masculine, socially acceptable playtime activities for boys. In our backyard sandbox, neighborhood parents looked on with satisfied approval. My father also cooked up a semantic fix for my misguided attraction. “We don’t call them dolls when boys play with them ― they’re action figures,” he would offer with a nervous laugh, wondering ― if not frightened ― what a doll fascination meant for his son’s development. So I received the Steve Austin “Six Million Dollar Man” doll ― I mean action figure ― whose bionic eye you could look through, as well as his boss Oscar Goldman who came with an exploding briefcase. Then there were the G.I. Joe dolls I was showered with by relatives who frowned on my Barbie obsession. I also found that action figures provided a sanctioned way for me to spend time with Barbie again, since these plastic men obviously needed female companions for adventures. Macho as he was, in my fantasy world, Barbie preferred G.I. Joe to bland Ken, and secretly saw him. Barbie might be criticized for promoting body dysmorphia, but G.I. Joe’s toxic masculinity caused its own problems. Wanting to resemble the soldier, I slashed my cheek with a tennis ball can lid so I could have a matching scar. Fortunately, it eventually healed without leaving a mark. The barely-hidden fear my dad and other adults had about me playing with dolls was that it might make me gay. The connection between such play and gay identity has been examined by academics, who often analyze the experiences of men like me. Some of this research might now be considered outdated if not homophobic, even if it was advanced for its time, like Richard Green’s 1987 book examining “The Sissy Boy Phenomenon” based on 15 years of research. Others, like Peter Hegarty, refer to such research’s shortcomings and how using childhood play, which breaks gender norms as a homosexual adulthood predictor, overlooks stigma, a process he called the “gender identity disorder in childhood (GIDC) paradigm” in a 2008 Developmental Psychology article. Intriguingly, Barbie herself ― and what she potentially meant to the boys who played with her ― doesn’t seem to be mentioned when I looked through these articles. My relationship with Barbie changed when I was a young adult and I came out of the closet. She could finally ― and openly ― be a part of my life. In the 1990s, when I lived in New Brunswick, New Jersey, while getting a master’s at Rutgers, I literally cooked in my own kitschy Barbie Dream Kitchen, a dreamy 1950s-themed room complete with pink vintage appliances, a pink dinette set and pink Fiesta Ware. To keep visitors entertained at parties I would often throw, I covered the pink walls with Barbie dioramas that presented gay story lines, like Barbie dumping Ken for a woman and moving to Hawaii when that state pioneered domestic partnership laws, long before same-sex marriage. The more I looked during the early coming out period of my life, the more I saw how intertwined Barbie is with gay culture. Bathrooms in gay bars were often adorned with Barbies and Kens dressed in everything from Bob Mackie ensembles to custom leather fetish wear to absolutely nothing at all. Fire Island and Provincetown gardens didn’t have gnomes, instead they were decorated with Barbies in their bushes. Of course, promoters capitalize on this gay Barbie Boy connection now. In fact, the largest billboard for the movie I saw on a recent trip to Sydney was in the gay neighborhood Darlinghurst, with native Australian Margot Robbie decked out in Barbie’s classic 1959 black and white swimsuit, rising over the area’s rainbow flags. When I became a gay uncle ― or “guncle” ― to my niece Evangelia, I got the chance to indulge in my Barbie obsession (one that my sisters still share) all over again. In fact, we frequently told my niece ― who is now a performer who plays real dress-up on stage ― “you have to keep playing with Barbie, because we need an excuse,” even after she had outgrown the doll. Fate is sometimes good to guncles and now I buy Barbies for my great niece Zoe. Now I’m thrilled to welcome the new Barbie film, which appears to champion all kinds of diverse Barbies and Kens and offers us a new way to think about and appreciate this iconic doll. We’ve come a long way from where we were when Barbie debuted in 1959, and I owe her a lot. I’m not sure who I’d be without my adventures with her, even if we got into trouble or made people anxious. Because Barbie obviously isn’t real (no matter what the new movie tells us), I can’t thank her for everything I’ve gained from my relationship with her, but, luckily I did get to thank another huge influence in my young gay doll-loving life. In 2012, I met Marlo Thomas at the premiere of Evita on Broadway. “Who was she?” asked my gay Argentine friend who was only interested in meeting stars who were recognizable back home. “She’s someone who changed my life,” I said, trying to explain the album that helped me survive my childhood. I’m not sure he got it, but it doesn’t matter. It’s part of what got me where I am now, and, like my decadeslong love for Barbie, I no longer need anyone to understand it or approve of it. It’s mine, it made me who I am, and I’ll never be ashamed of it again. A New Jersey native, Michael Luongo is a journalist, photographer and educator who lives in New York City and Indiana.

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that it is not only a memorable day for the young recruits but also a historic day for the nation as today marks the day when the Tiranga was accepted in its current form by the Constituent Assembly for the first time in 1947. The Prime Minister remarked that it is a matter of great inspiration that the new recruits are receiving their appointment letter for government services on this significant day as he encouraged them to take the country’s name forward. He underlined that it is a result of the hard work and determination of the new recruits that they are getting the opportunity to contribute towards the goal of Viksit Bharat at a time when India is celebrating Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. The Prime Minister congratulated the recruits and their families on this momentous occasion. In the Azadi ka Amrit Kaal, the Prime Minister said that every citizen has taken the resolve to make India a ‘Viksit Bharat’. He emphasized that the next 25 years are extremely crucial for the new recruits and the nation as he stressed making the most out of the trust, significance and attraction towards India from the world in recent years. He highlighted the rise of India in the leading economies as it jumped from the 10th to the 5th largest economy of the world. He also reiterated that India is going to become one of the top 3 economies in the world as stated by most economic experts. “Becoming a top 3 economy in the world will be a monumental achievement for India”, the Prime Minister said as he highlighted that it will give rise to employment opportunities in every sector and also boost the income of the common citizens. He remarked that there cannot be a better time than today to be recruited by the government as the new officers have got the golden opportunity to serve the country in its Amrit Kaal. He suggested that their priorities should lie with serving the people of the country and resolving their issues to increase ease of living, while also aligning themselves with the goals of Viksit Bharat. “A small effort from you can create a huge change in someone’s life”, the Prime Minister said as he reiterated that the populace is the form of God and serving them is like serving God itself. He emphasized that the new appointees should work with the belief of serving others to unlock the greatest feeling of satisfaction. Talking about the banking sector which had a good number of recruits in today’s programme, the Prime Minister underlined the role of the banking sector in the expansion of the economy. “Today, India is among the countries whose banking sector is considered to be the strongest”, said Shri Modi recalling the journey of the last nine years. He dwelled on the ill impact of political selfishness on the sector in the past. He mentioned ‘phone banking’ of the past when loans were disbursed on the phone calls of the powerful. These loans were never repaid, he said. These scams broke the back of the banking sector of the country, he said. He listed the measures taken after 2014 to retrieve the situation. He mentioned strengthening of management of the government banks, stress on professionalism and consolidation of small banks into large banks. Shri Modi said that by insuring deposits up to 5 lakhs, more than 99 percent of deposits became safe leading to a renewed trust in the banking system. By acts like the Bankruptcy Code, banks were protected from losses. Furthermore, by tightening the grip over those who looted the government property by attaching their property, the banks known for losses and NPA are being discussed for their record profit. The Prime Minister expressed pride in the hard work of the employees of the banking sector. “People of the banking sector never disappointed me or my vision”, he said. The Prime Minister hailed the efforts of the banking sector in making the Jan Dhan Account scheme a huge success by opening 50 crore Jan Dhan Accounts. This was a great help in transferring money into the accounts of crores of women during the pandemic. Speaking on the efforts for the betterment of the MSME sector, the Prime Minister mentioned Mudra Yojana which provided collateral-free loans to the enterprising youth. He praised the banking sector for making the scheme a success. Similarly, the banking sector rose up to the occasion when the government doubled the loan amount for women Self Help Groups and helped the MSMe sector by providing loans which saved 1.5 crores jobs by protecting small enterprises. He also thanked the bank employees for making PM Kisan Samman Nidhi a grand success. More than 50 lakh Street Vendors were helped in the SVANidhi Scheme. “I am sure, you will take a ‘Sankalp Patra (resolution letter) for making banking a tool of empowerment of the poor along with your ‘Niyukti Patra’ (appointment letter). The Prime Minister said the recent NITI report has found that 13 crore Indians were brought above the poverty line in the last 5 years. He acknowledged the hard work of government servants in this and mentioned schemes for pucca houses, toilets and electricity connections. “When these schemes reached the poor, their morale also increased. This success is a symbol of the fact that if together we increase the efforts to remove poverty from India, then poverty can be completely eliminated from India. And certainly, every government employee of the country has a big role in this”, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister highlighted another dimension of decreasing poverty in the country, which is the expansion of the neo-middle class, which is creating new job opportunities. Growing demand and aspirations of the neo-middle class are driving manufacturing. He highlighted that it is the youth of the country who benefit the most from the boosting production in India’s factories and industries. He also mentioned how India is creating new records every day be it mobile phone exports, the number of cars sold in the first 6 months of 2023, and record sales for electric vehicles. “All such activities are boosting employment and employment opportunities in the country”, he added. “The entire world is keeping an eye on India’s talent”, the Prime Minister said as he noted the issue of a declining working population due to higher average age in many developed economies in the world. Therefore, the Prime Minister said, this is the time for the youth of India to toil and enhance their skills and capabilities. Highlighting the great demand for India’s IT talent, doctors and nurses, the Prime Minister said that the respect for Indian talent is continuously growing in every country and every sector. The Prime Minister highlighted that in the last 9 years, the government has focused on skill development where about 1.5 crore youth have been trained under PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana. He also mentioned setting up 30 Skill India International Centers so the youth can be prepared for global opportunities. The Prime Minister also touched upon building new medical colleges, ITIs, IITs and technical institutes across the country and informed that till 2014, there were only about 380 medical colleges in our country whereas this number has increased to more than 700 in the last 9 years. He also mentioned the significant increase in the number of nursing colleges. “Skills that meet global demand are going to create lakhs of new opportunities for the youth of India”, Shri Modi added. The Prime Minister also urged them to continue the process of learning and self-development and take maximum advantage of IGoT Karmayogi, an online learning platform prepared by the government.

      "text": "The Delhi High Court Saturday refused to interfere with the exemption granted to top wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia from Asian Games trials. Justice Subramonium Prasad dismissed the petition by Under-20 World Champion Antim Panghal and Under-23 Asian Champion Sujeet Kalkal against the direct entry allowed to Phogat and Punia to participate in the tournament. “Writ petition is dismissed,” the judge said. A detailed copy of the order is awaited. Phogat (53kg) and Punia (65kg) were given direct entry for the Asian Games by the Indian Olympic Association's ad-hoc committee on Tuesday, while other wrestlers will have to earn their places in the Indian squad through selection trials on July 22 and 23. Panghal and Kalkal moved the high court on July 19 challenging the exemption and demanded a fair selection process for the quadrennial showpiece event. The petition, moved by advocates Hrishikesh Baruah and Akshay Kumar, had demanded that the directive issued by the IOA ad-hoc committee with regard to the two categories (men's freestyle 65kg and women's 53kg) be quashed and the exemption granted to Phogat and Punia set aside.",

      "title": "Massive angry protests across India over women paraded naked and assaulted in Manipur state",
      "text": "Thousands of people, mostly women, held a massive sit-in in India’s violence-wracked northeastern state of Manipur on Saturday demanding the immediate arrest of those involved in the harrowing mob assaults on two women who were paraded naked. Religious and women organisation leaders addressed nearly 15,000 protesters who also called for the sacking of Biren Singh, the top elected official in the state where more than 130 people have been killed since violence between two dominant ethnic groups erupted in early May. The protest was held in Churachandpur, a town 65 south of Imphal, the state capital. A video showing the assaults on women triggered massive outrage and was widely shared on social media late Wednesday despite the internet being largely blocked and journalists locked out of the remote state. The footage shows the two naked women surrounded by scores of young men who grope their genitals and drag them to a field. Furious Indian women burn down houses of two suspects after naked parade video Police said the assault occurred May 4, a day after the violence started. According to a police complaint filed on May 18, the two women were part of a family attacked by a mob that killed its two male members. The complaint alleges rape and murder by “unknown miscreants.” The state government on Saturday announced the arrest of a fifth suspects. Rajiv Singh, the state’s director general of police, said police were carrying out raids to arrest other suspects. Manipur has been the scene of a near-civil war that was sparked when Christian Kukis protested a demand by the mostly Hindu Meiteis for a special status that would let them buy land in the hills populated by Kukis and other tribal groups, as well as a guaranteed share of government jobs. Clashes have persisted despite the army’s presence in Manipur, a state of 3.2 million people tucked in the mountains on India’s border with Myanmar that is now divided into two ethnic zones. More than 60,000 people have fled to packed relief camps. Nearly 400 men and women also held a protest in the Indian capital with the similar demands. They carried placards reading “We demand action against the perpetrators” and “Resign, Biren Singh”. In Manipur state, the protesters assembled at a Wall of Remembrance site in an open ground in Churachandpur, a stronghold of the Kuki tribe, where they kept dummy coffins of people of their minority community killed in the violence. Ngaineikim, the chairperson of the Kuki Women Organisation for Human Rights, accused Singh, who belongs to the majority Meiti community, of orchestrating atrocities, then expressing sympathy with the victims. Singh did not comment immediately but on Thursday said that an investigation was under way to ensure “strict action is taken against all the perpetrators, including considering the possibility of capital punishment. Let it be known, there is absolutely no place for such heinous acts in our society.”",
