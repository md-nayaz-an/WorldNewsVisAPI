      "title": "Elon Musk’s unmatched power in the stars",
      "text": "On March 17, Gen. Mark Milley, the chair of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the leader of Ukraine’s armed forces, dialed into a call to discuss Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Over the secure line, the two military leaders conferred on air defense systems, real-time battlefield assessments and shared intelligence on Russia’s military losses. They also talked about Elon Musk. Zaluzhnyi raised the topic of Starlink, the satellite internet technology made by Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, three people with knowledge of the conversation said. Ukraine’s battlefield decisions depended on the continued use of Starlink for communications, Zaluzhnyi said, and his country wanted to ensure access and discuss how to cover the cost of the service. Zaluzhnyi also asked if the United States had an assessment of Musk, who has sprawling business interests and murky politics — to which U.S. officials gave no answer. Musk, who leads SpaceX, Tesla and Twitter, has become the most dominant player in space as he has steadily amassed power over the strategically significant field of satellite internet. Yet faced with little regulation and oversight, his erratic and personality-driven style has increasingly worried militaries and political leaders around the world, with the tech billionaire sometimes wielding his authority in unpredictable ways. Since 2019, Musk has sent SpaceX rockets into space nearly every week that deliver dozens of sofa-size satellites into orbit. The satellites communicate with terminals on Earth, so they can beam high-speed internet to nearly every corner of the planet. Today, more than 4,500 Starlink satellites are in the skies, accounting for more than 50% of all active satellites. They have already started changing the complexion of the night sky, even before accounting for Musk’s plans to have as many as 42,000 satellites in orbit in the coming years. The power of the technology, which has helped push the value of closely held SpaceX to nearly $140 billion, is just beginning to be felt. Starlink is often the only way to get internet access in war zones, remote areas and places hit by natural disasters. It is used in Ukraine for coordinating drone strikes and intelligence gathering. Activists in Iran and Turkey have sought to use the service as a hedge against government controls. The U.S. Defense Department is a big Starlink customer, while other militaries, such as in Japan, are testing the technology. But Musk’s near total control of satellite internet has raised alarms. A combustible personality, the 52-year-old’s allegiances are fuzzy. While Musk is hailed as a genius innovator, he alone can decide to shut down Starlink internet access for a customer or country, and he has the ability to leverage sensitive information that the service gathers. Such concerns have been heightened because no companies or governments have come close to matching what he has built. In Ukraine, some fears have been realized. Musk has restricted Starlink access multiple times during the war, people familiar with the situation said. At one point, he denied the Ukrainian military’s request to turn on Starlink near Crimea, the Russian-controlled territory, affecting battlefield strategy. Last year, he publicly floated a \"peace plan” for the war that seemed aligned with Russian interests. At times, Musk has openly flaunted Starlink’s capabilities. \"Between, Tesla, Starlink & Twitter, I may have more real-time global economic data in one head than anyone ever,” he tweeted in April. Musk did not respond to requests for comment. SpaceX declined to comment. Worried about overdependence on Musk’s technology, Ukrainian officials have talked with other satellite internet providers, though they acknowledged none rival Starlink’s reach. \"Starlink is indeed the blood of our entire communication infrastructure now,” Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s digital minister, said in an interview. At least nine countries — including in Europe and the Middle East — have also brought up Starlink with U.S. officials over the past 18 months, with some questioning Musk’s power over the technology, two U.S. intelligence officials briefed on the discussions said. Few nations will speak publicly about their concerns, for fear of alienating Musk, said intelligence and cybersecurity officials briefed on the conversations. U.S. officials have said little publicly about Starlink as they balance domestic and geopolitical priorities related to Musk, who has criticized President Joe Biden but whose technology is unavoidable. The federal government is one of SpaceX’s biggest customers, using its rockets for NASA missions and launching military surveillance satellites. Senior Pentagon officials have tried mediating issues involving Starlink, particularly Ukraine, a person familiar with the discussions said. The Defense Department confirmed it contracts with Starlink, but it declined to elaborate, citing \"the critical nature of these systems.” Other governments are wary. Taiwan, which has an internet infrastructure that could be vulnerable in the event of a Chinese invasion, is reluctant to use the service partly because of Musk’s business links to China, Taiwanese and U.S. officials said. China has its own concerns. Musk said last year that Beijing sought assurances that he would not turn Starlink on inside the country, where the internet is controlled and censored by the state. In 2020, China registered with an international body to launch 13,000 internet satellites of its own. The European Union, partly driven by misgivings about Starlink and Musk, also earmarked €2.4 billion ($2.6 billion) last year to build a satellite constellation for civilian and military use. \"This is not just one company, but one person,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, a cybersecurity expert who co-founded the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank and has advised governments on satellite internet. \"You are completely beholden to his whims and desires.” Reaching for the skies Sir Martin Sweeting, a British engineer who founded the satellite design and manufacturing company Surrey Satellite Technology, was encouraged by a business associate in 2001 to meet with a \"chap who wants to put a greenhouse on Mars.” It turned out to be Musk. Sweeting and Musk met soon after for breakfast at a space conference in Colorado, where the tech entrepreneur criticized NASA and talked about building a private space fleet. \"He was very focused,” said Sweeting, whose company later received an investment from Musk and had him on its board of directors before it sold to Airbus in 2009. Musk was also interested in an emerging field of research where small satellites are placed in the sky several hundred miles above sea level, an area known as \"low-Earth orbit,” Sweeting said. Their work together was one of the earliest examples of Musk’s focus on a technology that would help underpin Starlink. Satellites dating to the 1960s are typically bigger — often the size of school buses — and located higher in space, in what is known as \"geosynchronous orbit,” limiting their communication capabilities. Smaller satellites can orbit at a lower altitude, allowing them to link up with terminals on Earth to beam high-speed internet service to far-flung locations. Many small satellites are necessary for this to work. That’s because as one satellite moves above a Starlink terminal on land, it hands the internet signal to another satellite behind it to keep up a single, uninterrupted flow to users below. Musk launched his first Starlink satellites into orbit in 2019. At the time, satellite internet was viewed as a fool’s errand. In the 1990s and 2000s, other companies had pursued low-orbit communication satellites with little success because of the expense and technical difficulties of getting them into space. But Musk had an advantage. SpaceX’s rockets return to Earth after a trip to space and are partially reusable. This effectively gave him control of an express train to constantly deliver satellites to space, sometimes dozens at a time. Now nearly every week, a SpaceX rocket loaded with Starlink satellites takes off from a site in California or Florida. Each satellite is designed to work for about 3½ years. There are so many in orbit that they are often mistaken for shooting stars. Astronomers have documented how the devices have interfered with research telescopes and warned about the risk of collisions. \"The night sky is one of the most glorious shows that nature puts on and humans are changing it forever,” said Patrick Seitzer, an astronomer at the University of Michigan who studies orbital debris. Starlink provides internet download speeds typically around 100 megabits per second, comparable to many landline services. SpaceX generally charges individual customers about $600 for each terminal that receives a connection from space, plus a monthly service fee of about $75, with costs higher for businesses and governments. The company knows the location, movement and altitude of each Starlink terminal, experts said. The service, which officially debuted in 2021 in a handful of countries, is now available in more than 50 countries and territories, including the United States, Japan, much of Europe and parts of Latin America. In Africa, where internet access lags the rest of the world, Starlink is available in Nigeria, Mozambique and Rwanda, with more than a dozen other countries following by the end of 2024, according to Starlink’s website. \"Everywhere on Earth will have high bandwidth, low latency internet,” Musk predicted on the Joe Rogan podcast in 2020. Militaries, telecom companies, airlines, cruise lines and maritime shippers have flocked to Starlink, which has said it has more than 1.5 million subscribers. Rivals have struggled, though competition is growing. OneWeb, a British company, was so plagued by financial difficulties that it had to be bailed out by the British government and sold to a group of investors. Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos, who owns the rocket company Blue Origin, plans a Starlink competitor, Project Kuiper, but it has yet to get a satellite into space. Lifeline on the battlefield No event has demonstrated Starlink’s power — and Musk’s influence — more than the war in Ukraine. More than 42,000 Starlink terminals are now used in Ukraine by the military, hospitals, businesses and aid organizations. During Russian bombing campaigns last year that caused widespread blackouts, Ukraine’s public agencies turned to Starlink to stay online. \"Without Starlink, we cannot fly, we cannot communicate,” said one Ukrainian deputy commander who goes by the nickname Zub, or Tooth, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons. Starlink entered Ukraine in February 2022, when Russia invaded and a cyberattack — later attributed to Russia — took down a satellite system run by the high-speed communications company Viasat that was being used by the Ukrainian military. With troops and commanders knocked offline, Fedorov, the digital minister, posted a plea to Musk for help. Within hours, Musk contacted Fedorov to say that Starlink had been activated in Ukraine. Days later, Starlink terminals arrived. The technology — found in forests, fields, villages and mounted on the roofs of military vehicles — has given Ukraine’s army a major advantage over Russian forces. It has enabled artillery teams, commanders and pilots to watch drone footage simultaneously while chatting online. The response times from finding a target to hitting it have been cut to about a minute from nearly 20 minutes, soldiers said. \"The huge number of lives that Starlink has helped save can be measured in the thousands,” Fedorov said. But concerns among Ukrainian and Western officials about Musk’s hold over the technology have grown, coming to a head last fall when he repeatedly made comments about the war that raised questions about his commitment to Starlink’s service in Ukraine. In September, at a private event on world and business affairs in Aspen, Colorado, which was attended by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others, Musk proposed a peace plan for Ukraine that included Russia annexing Ukrainian land. The proposal outraged many attendees. Around this time, questions arose about who would pay for Starlink’s service in Ukraine. SpaceX had initially covered some of the costs, with the United States and other allies also providing funding. That same month, SpaceX told the U.S. Defense Department that it could not continue the arrangement and asked the Pentagon to take over funding. The company estimated the cost at nearly $400 million over 12 months, according to a SpaceX letter reported by CNN, which was verified by The New York Times. The Biden administration directed a top Pentagon official, Colin H. Kahl, to mediate. On Oct. 7, Kahl called Musk, who expressed fears that Ukraine would use Starlink to not just defend itself, but also conduct offensive operations to regain territory seized by Russia, which could cause significant Russian military casualties, a former administration official said. Kahl told Musk more people in Ukraine would suffer if Starlink was shut down. Musk nonetheless turned off access for some Starlink terminals in Ukraine. Late last year, about 1,300 Starlink terminals purchased through a British supplier stopped working in the country after the Ukrainian government could not pay the $2,500 monthly fee for each, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Starlink access also fluctuated depending on the movements of the war as Russia won territory and Ukraine fought to take it back. As the battle lines shifted, Musk used a process called geofencing to restrict where Starlink was available on the front lines. SpaceX uses location data gathered by its service to enforce geofencing limits. This caused problems. When Ukrainian troops tried retaking cities like Kherson in Russian-controlled areas in the fall, they needed internet access to communicate. Fedorov and members of the armed forces messaged Musk and SpaceX employees requests to restore service in areas where the army was advancing. Fedorov said SpaceX responded \"very promptly.” Musk had other red lines that he would not cross. He refused Ukraine’s request last year to provide Starlink access near Crimea, the Russian-controlled peninsula, so it could send an explosive-filled maritime drone into Russian ships docked in the Black Sea, two people familiar with the discussions said. Musk later said that Starlink could not be used for long-range drone strikes. Other U.S. officials have weighed in. In June, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin approved a Pentagon deal to buy 400 to 500 new Starlink terminals and services. The deal gives the Pentagon control of setting where Starlink’s internet signal works inside Ukraine for those new devices to carry out \"key capabilities and certain missions,” two people familiar with the deal said. This appeared intended to provide Ukraine with dedicated terminals and services to conduct sensitive functions without fear of interruption. Unlike traditional defense contractors, whose weapon sales to foreign countries are typically done through the federal government, Starlink is a commercial product. That allows Musk to act in ways that sometimes do not align with U.S. interests, such as when SpaceX said it could not continue funding Starlink in Ukraine, said Gregory C. Allen, a former Defense Department official who worked at Blue Origin. \"It has certainly been a long time since we’ve seen a company and an individual like this go pretty openly against U.S. foreign policy in the middle of a war,” said Allen, who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Musk’s behavior has divided Ukrainian officials. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Twitter in February that SpaceX needed to pick a side. But Fedorov said questions about Musk’s commitment were unfair. When Ukraine was under heavy bombardment and facing major power outages in November, Musk helped expedite the delivery of about 10,000 Starlink terminals, he said. \"SpaceX and Elon Musk have shown through their deeds whose side they are actually on,” Fedorov said. From Taiwan to Turkey In February, two undersea internet cables running between Taiwan’s main island and the outlying islands of Matsu were severed by Chinese shipping vessels. The incident interrupted online access across Matsu, intensifying concerns that Taiwan’s communications infrastructure was vulnerable. Taiwan, which China has claimed as its own territory, would seem to be an ideal place to bring in Starlink. But Taiwan was reluctant — a concern increasingly echoed elsewhere as governments weigh the power of satellite internet against the risks of working with Musk. Taiwanese officials had spoken with SpaceX about Starlink, said Jason Hsu, a former Taiwan legislator who advises the government on digital infrastructure. But talks slowed partly because of \"tremendous concerns” about Musk, whose financial interests are tied to China, he said. With roughly 50% of new Tesla cars estimated to be manufactured in Shanghai, Taiwan did not trust Musk to provide Starlink access if Beijing applied pressure to turn off the service, he added. \"We worry that if we order devices from Starlink, we’ll fall into some sort of trap,” said Hsu, now a senior research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School in Taipei. \"Elon has huge commercial interests in China.” When a U.S. congressional delegation visited Taiwan in April, Rep. Michael McCaul, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, asked the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, during a lunch about potentially using Starlink, according to committee staff on the trip. Tsai was noncommittal. Congressional aides concluded soon after that the service was not a viable option for Taiwan because of Musk’s links to China, the committee staff said. Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s digital minister, said the country struck a deal with OneWeb in June and had not ruled out working with any satellite provider. \"We want to test as many constellations as possible,” she said. Musk’s influence has been debated elsewhere. In the European Union, concerns about Starlink’s dominance influenced the 27-nation bloc to set aside €2.4 billion last year for a \"sovereign” satellite constellation, to launch as soon as 2027. \"Space has become a highly contested domain where the European Union must safeguard its vital interests,” said Thierry Breton, the European commissioner overseeing the project. \"The EU cannot afford to be reliant on others.” To address government needs, SpaceX last year introduced a Starlink-related service, Starshield, that offered stronger security for handling classified material and processing sensitive data. Starlink also faces criticism from more authoritarian governments. When anti-government protests broke out in Iran last year, Musk made Starlink available there to help activists stay online. The Iranian government accused SpaceX of violating its sovereignty. China complained this year to a U.N. panel that SpaceX was putting so many satellites into orbit that it would prevent others from accessing space. In February, Turkey refused Musk’s offer to provide Starlink access after a major earthquake, which civil society groups viewed as an effort to prevent unfavorable news from spreading online. \"The government was afraid that Starlink is not under its control, and could represent a threat,” said Chérif El Kadhi, a policy analyst tracking Turkey for Access Now, a digital rights organization. Musk’s dominance in space is unlikely to be equaled any time soon. In May, Amazon prepared to put its first two satellites into orbit, but the launch was put on hold after a problem was discovered in rocket testing. Since then, Musk has sent at least 595 more Starlink satellites into space.",

His name is Elon Musk and, in case you just woke up from a long coma, he recently bought social media platform Twitter for the tidy sum of US$44 billion (AU$65.7 billion). And then, with all the grace and good manners of a mentally deranged octopus falling out of a tree, proceeded to attack the value of his asset in a variety of new and unexpected ways.

And all the while tweeting - and tweeting, and tweeting and tweeting - increasingly absurd and inane idiocies. Elon Musk, the world's richest cooker, has made Twitter taste terrible Is he on drugs? Has he entirely lost his mind? Or is he just king of the super wealthy weirdos, doing whatever the hell he wants, as he has always done, as he has always felt entitled to do? Read on to discover the truth behind this rather strange fellow and his unseemly new dalliance with social media. WHO IS ELON MUSK? The first thing to note about Elon Musk is that he is an entirely self-made man... Just kidding! Musk, in fact, was born into a super-wealthy Afrikaans/Pennsylvania Dutch/Canadian family in South Africa in 1971 and since then has just gotten richer! He is listed by Forbes magazine and Bloomberg as the richest man in the world at present, with an estimated net worth of US$185 billion (AU$276 billion - as of 15 November 2022). So, perhaps losing US$44 billion is not such a big deal to Musk? Although it seems that it is, because upon taking control of Twitter he sacked half the staff, saying the company couldn't afford them because it was losing US$4 million (AU$5.9 million) a day. He has since sacked a whole heap more people from Twitter, the bastard. And what a jerk he is! Like in 2019, after he called the valiant 63-year-old British diver who saved 12 kids stuck in a cave in Thailand a 'pedo guy'. The rescuer, Vernon Unsworth, unsurprisingly sued Musk for defamation. But Musk managed to convince the best court his money could buy that, when he was growing up in South Africa, \"pedo guy\" just meant \"creepy old man\" - not paedophile at all. Sure! And that, moreover, everyone all around the world now uses \"pedo guy\" the way they did in Pretoria when Elon was growing up. Jesus wept! There is not enough space to discuss just how much of an oddball Musk is, so let's sample just a few of Musk's strange contradictions. My part in Elon Musk's horrifying and tragic Everest catastrophe (Chapter One) A WEIRD, MUSKY AROMA Musk gained a lot of progressive admirers by being the CEO of Tesla, the big electric car company. He has also been involved in large solar projects and even advocated for a carbon tax. On the other hand, Musk strongly opposes a billionaire's tax and has pumped untold megatons of carbon into the atmosphere in his seemingly endless, fruitless quest to build a rocket ship to Mars that can land on the red planet. As you do. Musk has long been regarded as a progressive and voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. He also advocated for Democrat Andrew Yang at the 2020 presidential primaries and says he voted for Joe Biden earlier this year. On the other hand, Musk called for people to vote for the Republicans at the recent U.S. midterm elections and likened progressive Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler. He compared Trudeau to Hitler because of Canada's strict COVID controls. Musk has called COVID nothing more than a 'specific form of the common cold' and has advocated for the use of chloroquine as a cure. He also believes artificial intelligence will take over the world, leading to him being awarded the 2016 Luddite of the Year award. Mind you, Musk strongly supports the science of climate change and... oh well, you get the point. Which is that Musk is as mad as a bag full of black snakes and even he has, in some rare sane moments, warned staff that Twitter could go bankrupt. His panacea seems to be a subscription service, in which people can pay US$8 (AU$12) and receive a verification tick. He even has a nice T-shirt to promote this service. Unfortunately, he has also sacked half the staff, leading to scammers registering well-known brands such as, well, Jesus Christ and drugmaker Eli Lilly. In the case of Eli Lilly, the maker of insulin, one tweet purporting to be from them proclaiming 'insulin is free now' wiped billions off the share price in a matter of hours. Because of this, the Securities and Exchange Commission is circling, as are privacy regulators. Musk faced court last Friday over the exorbitant pay package he receives as CEO of Tesla that made him the richest man in the world. Perhaps after Twitter breaks and everyone leaves, and the courts, regulators, shareholders, creditors and lawyers feast on what remains of his fortune, Musk can continue to send out his memes on Mastodon or whatever serves to replace Twitter as the \"global town square\". Perhaps from gaol, if there is a God. But I wouldn't count on it. Because, after all, it's a mad, mad, Musky world! Follow IA founder David G Donovan on Twitter @davrosz.

      "title": "MMA champs offer to train Elon Musk for cage match -- because they hate Mark Zuckerberg",
      "text": "A who’s-who of MMA fighters have a beef with Mark Zuckerberg — so they’re throwing their weight behind Elon Musk ahead of a possible cage match between the tech titans. At least eight UFC fighters, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu champions, and more, led by former MMA champ Chad Robichaux are offering to train Musk for the proposed cage fight with Meta CEO Zuckerberg over his launch of micro-blogging rival Threads. For some of them, this is about payback. “No one likes Zuckerberg because he’s a communist that’s suppressing our speech, and ruining most of our businesses,” Robichaux told The Post. “We feel like he needs his a– beat.” “I’ve been a victim of having my First Amendment rights violated by Zuckerberg,” Robichaux, who runs the Mighty Oaks Foundation, a veterans group, explained. “Every every Monday I have to have a staff meeting and we have to figure out what we can and can’t say so we don’t get suppressed.” The martial-arts masters see 52-year-old Musk as their chance for revenge — even as Musk and Zuck have lately jabs on social media over a possible cage match. Most recently, Musk claimed on his social network X — formerly known as Twitter — that he planned to drive by Zuckerberg’s house to see if he “actually answers the door.” “Mark is traveling right now and isn’t in Palo Alto,” a spokesperson for Zuckerberg responded. “Also, Mark takes this sport seriously and isn’t going to fight someone who randomly shows up at his house.” The trash-talking comes even as Zuckerberg last month launched Threads, a challenger to X, which quickly amassed 100 million sign-ups — more than a quarter of X’s active user base. Activity on Threads — which Meta executives said is “focusing on kindness and making this a friendly place” — appears to have fallen sharply since, according to research reports. As for the literal cage match, “I would love to see Elon win, that’d be a great win for mankind in my opinion,” BJJ champion Thomas Cronin told The Post, noting his philosophical alignment with the space and electric-car guru. Other eight champions currently on board include: UFC fighter Jalen Turner, former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Quinton Jackson, Strikeforce Champion and UFC title contender Nate Marquardt, current UFC contender Alex Morono, seasoned Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instructor Vinicius Draculino Magalhaes, and Carlson Gracie Jr., whose father Carlos Gracie is considered one of the founders of Brazilian Jiu-Jistu. “I have to side with Elon Musk … [because] of free speech. Zuckerberg is kind of taking away free speech on his platforms,” Jackson said. “Musk is more of a stand up guy.” Not much is known about Musk’s master strategy to avert total annihilation from Zuckerberg. In June, he quipped on X that one of his moves is called “’The Walrus,’ where I just lie on top of my opponent and do nothing.” “I mean, with the size difference he probably could do it for a bit,” Turner, a top 15 UFC lightweight contender, laughed. “I think Elon Musk has a good sense of humor,” Jackson mused when asked about “The Walrus.” Robichaux observed that “The Walrus” sounds a lot like a “Wet Blanket” technique he deploys via Jiu-Jitsu to wear down his enemies to the point of exhaustion and frustration so they start making mistakes. “It’s good. He’s a bigger guy,” Robichaux quipped. “He [could] use his body weight to like fatigue Zuckerberg — to make him work to constantly get up.” Still, the jostling maestros think they can do much better. Cronin, a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu coach who has trained a myriad of UFC fighters, has been studying up on Zuckerberg and is already spotting some vulnerabilities ripe for exploitation. “There’s a couple of things that I see in Zuckerberg’s training that they’re not really addressing, as far as I can tell. And we want to capitalize on those positions,” Cronin said. Cronin believes he knows “exactly how” Zuckerberg is going to come out and knows just how Musk can “throw a wrench in his plans.” He is keeping specifics close to the vest. Jackson contended that Musk would be in jeopardy if he winds up in a ground tussle, given Zuckerberg’s considerable Jiu-Jitsu edge. “If I was Elon Musk, I wouldn’t take him to the ground for one second,” Jackson said emphasizing he’d try his best to keep it standing. Gracie Jr., a six-time Brazilian National Champion in Freestyle and Greco Roman wrestling also known as “The Prince of BJJ,” cautioned against “overtraining’ Musk into exhaustion. “We’d have to work in some kind of basic fundamental techniques, and first, you have to evaluate his level and from there we can work on [him],” Gracie Jr. told The Post. Questions have swirled over whether the fight will ever come to fruition. Zuckerberg has sewed doubts, claiming that Musk is “not serious” and that “it’s time to move on.” Musk, who previously challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to single combat in a Hail Mary bid to rescue Ukraine from devastation, claimed that Italian officials agreed to an “epic location” for the internet kingpin rumble. However, Italian culture minister Gennaro Sangiuliano appeared to quash speculation of a much-rumored “Gladiator”-style showdown at the ancient Colosseum, stipulating “it will not be held in Rome.” Zuckerberg has urged fans to “assume anything [Musk] says has not been agreed on.” Musk has also claimed that he needed an “MRI of my neck & upper back” and “may require surgery before the fight can happen.” Should Musk begin training, one adjustment the martial arts battalion would likely gently nudge him into making is his diet. Musk, who posits there’s a high probability we’re living in a simulation, has raved about soul-enriching junk food, claiming (possibly joking) to eat a donut every morning. Zuckerberg, who is seeking to build up a simulation of his own for humans to traverse, says he eats 4,000 calories a day to fuel his intense exercise regimen, often including hefty McDonalds’ orders, which he dubbed “so delicious.” “[Musk] probably needs like a good 30 days on a good healthy diet regimen to cleanse his system and have the energy,” Robichaux said, “just to get his system functioning well and have his body fueled up.” Another potential hurdle for Musk is the roughly 13-year age gap with Zuckerberg. Robichaux, some four years younger than Musk, stressed that Musk can overcome it, noting how he eats younger fighters for breakfast. “I’m 48. I smash 18 and 20 year old kids in the gym every day,” Robichaux joked in a dead serious way. “There’s something about this generation.” Another option is rejuvenating stem cell therapy. Eric Scoffers, CEO of Bioexcellorator, a firm that specializes in the treatment, told The Post “we will roll out the red carpet for Elon to make sure he’s in the best shape to beat Zuckerberg.” “Bioexcellorator is the exclusive stem cell treatment center for the UFC,” he added. “They’re treating current UFC champions. The treatment they offer will close the age gap between Musk and Zuckerberg.” The squadron of fighters have various visions for what a boot camp would look like, but are flexible to Musk’s liking. At least one of the martial artists is stunned that the plutocrats want to subject themselves to such violent brutality rather than live out a cushy lifestyle. “I was really surprised that two billionaires want to duke it out in the cage. I’ve been a fighter for over 20-something years. If I was a billionaire, I would not step foot in a cage — no way,” Jackson said. “I started it as a way to provide for my family — to me it was a hustle,” he added. “I did it to pay the bills.” Musk has previously suggested that the billionaire melee will raise money for veterans and pediatric hospitals in Italy. Robichaux’s squad is hoping they might consider donating some of those funds to The Mighty Oaks Foundation. The group works to tackle post-traumatic stress disorder and prevent veteran suicide. Robichaux is credited with spearheading one of the largest known civilian evacuation efforts out of Afghanistan in the aftermath of the Taliban takeover.",

      "title": "STEPHEN GLOVER: Who can look at oddball Elon Musk and his power over the Ukraine war and NOT feel...",
      "text": "Who is richer — the arch capitalist Elon Musk, or Ukraine with its population of over 40 million souls? By some measures, Musk has more money. A recent survey says he’s the world’s wealthiest person, with assets of $238 billion (around £185 billion). In 2022, the GDP of Ukraine — the value of all goods and services produced — was estimated at $150 billion (around £118 billion). One man richer than a big country — or at any rate, everything that country produces in a year. Before we feel condescending towards Ukraine, consider this: the technology company Apple is worth roughly the same as the UK’s GDP. Ours is an age in which a few American companies and multi-billionaires have amassed vast wealth on a scale unimaginable 30 or 40 years ago. They are richer, and potentially more powerful, than many nations. Elon Musk is at the forefront. He controls the electric car maker Tesla, Twitter (now called X), and SpaceX, a U.S. spacecraft manufacturer and satellite communications company. He is quixotic, impulsive, opinionated — and brilliant. Some libertarians believe it’s a good thing for tech companies to wield more influence than countries. They like the idea of hugely gifted, visionary entrepreneurs being more powerful than slow-footed governments. But what if one of these unshackled masters of destiny could determine the outcome of a major war? What if he could switch off a satellite system, and thereby deny one side vital access to it? That, incredibly, is the position of Elon Musk. Ukraine has been forced to abort several planned drone strikes on Russian targets after Musk refused to grant access to his Starlink satellite network, an authoritative report in the New York Times has claimed. In particular, it’s alleged that a recent plan by the Ukrainians to launch a drone to strike a Russian ship at a Black Sea base in occupied Crimea was abandoned after Musk’s company SpaceX pulled the plug. SpaceX reportedly denied the Ukrainian military use of its Starlink network, on which Ukraine is heavily dependent. The country’s armed forces chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, then sought contact with U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, asserting that Musk effectively dictates Ukraine’s capability to attack key Russian targets. You may ask: why shouldn’t Elon Musk prevent the Ukrainian government from using his satellites (SpaceX currently has around 4,000 of them, roughly half of all working satellites) in order to save lives? The answer depends on what you think about the rights and wrongs of the war in the Ukraine, and whether one fabulously wealthy private citizen should be allowed to affect the outcome of the conflict. Ukraine surely has the right to retaliate against Russian aggression, after Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked attack on its territory, which has led to the deaths of thousands of Ukrainians. I say this despite having had some sympathy for the Kremlin’s claims over ethnically Russian parts of eastern Ukraine before the invasion in February last year. All sympathy has been forfeited as a result of Russia’s barbaric behaviour. Musk was initially helpful to the Ukrainians. Two days after the invasion, he told them that the Starlink service had been turned on over Ukraine, and that hardware would follow. Lorries full of the flat dishes needed to access the satellites soon began to arrive in the country. Ukraine’s government quickly grew to rely on Starlink for communication. The country’s military became dependent on the network as other internet services were unavailable because of war damage or Russian jamming. It began to use Starlink to control drones. Musk’s contribution to the Ukrainian war effort was incalculable. It has cost his company tens of millions of dollars, though the U.S. government has increasingly shared the financial burden, with HMG reportedly chipping in too. But the tycoon became increasingly alarmed by the extensive use of Starlink by the Ukrainian military, and last year refused its request to provide it with access to Starlink near Crimea. Last October, the notoriously mercurial Musk came up with a peace plan that envisaged Russia retaining Crimea and possibly parts of eastern Ukraine. Then, in February, SpaceX’s chief operating officer, Gwynne Shotwell, announced that steps to prevent Starlink from being used to control drones had been taken because the company never intended it to be employed ‘for offensive purposes’. None of us can know the effect of denying the Ukrainians permission to use Starlink to control drones. It is evidently still finding ways of doing so. Only the other day, there was a drone attack on Moscow. But Musk’s decision plainly represents a serious blow to the country. It seems incredible that a man who doesn’t hold any rank in the military, or represent any government, should be playing such a pivotal role in the war. I don’t, of course, seek to compare him with any of those villains in James Bond films, who use enormous personal resources to gain technological supremacy over the superpowers, only to be thwarted at the last moment by an intrepid 007. Nonetheless, there is something slightly sinister about Elon Musk, partly because of the extraordinary power he wields, and partly because of bizarre character traits that make him so unpredictable. Here is a man who in 2018 decided to call a British caver who helped rescue trapped Thai schoolboys a ‘pedo guy’. There was absolutely no foundation for this insult. Musk didn’t know the man. Last year, when acquiring Twitter, he visited the company’s headquarters carrying a sink. He later tweeted, presumably thinking himself funny: ‘Let that sink in!’ In a similarly puerile vein, he recently had a Twitter spat with Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Meta, in which he suggested that the two men should have a contest to compare the size of their private parts. A strange fellow, whom you might edge away from if you met him in a pub. But he can hardly be ignored when he’s the world’s richest man, and could affect the outcome of the most serious European war since 1945. What should be done with Elon Musk? In principle, I’m thoroughly in favour of entrepreneurs, and happy to see them grow rich in return for the employment they offer and the innovations they bring. The problem arises if they want to run the world. Musk tweeted in April: ‘Between Tesla, Starlink and Twitter, I may have more real-time global economic data in one head than anyone ever.’ Scary? He plans to launch more than 40,000 satellites, so that he would own the sky. He hopes to build a rocket capable of taking people to Mars, and to create a permanent city on the planet. So far as Ukraine is concerned, Washington shouldn’t allow Musk to determine events. He is unelected, and answerable to no one except his shareholders, who only care about greater profits. Will Sleepy Joe or a future president stand up to him? I doubt it, not least because the U.S government is one of SpaceX’s biggest customers, using its rockets for NASA missions and launching military surveillance satellites. Elon Musk is a new kind of man. The world hasn’t seen his like before. He’s richer than the country, Ukraine, whose destiny he shapes. Who can look at him and not be afraid?",

      "title": "Biographer Teases How Elon Musk Met Grimes and Other Untold Stories",
      "text": "Between 2020 and 2022, best-selling author Walter Isaacson shadowed Elon Musk as research for his soon-to-be-released biography of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO. Isaacson has penned books about some of the greatest inventors in history, from Leonardo Davinci to Albert Einstein to Steve Jobs. His new project, Elon Musk, is set to arrive in bookstores on September 12. Last week, Isaacson began promoting the biography by posting snippets of his work, including excerpts and previously unseen photos of Musk on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. His latest revelation explores the origins of Musk’s romantic relationship with Canadian singer Grimes, which the author described as a “chaotic new subplot” in the tech billionaire’s otherwise workaholic life. Musk and Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher, made their public debut as a couple at the Met Gala in 2018. But it was never clear how they met each other and began dating until Grimes laid it out for Isaacson in an interview. She first met Musk in an elevator when Musk was with his former girlfriend Amber Heard. Musk and Heard broke up in early 2018, and he grew close with Grimes over their common interest in eclectic sci-fi ideas like Roko’s Basilisk, a thought experiment that posits uncontrolled artificial general intelligence would torture any human who had not helped it gain power. “These are the types of things that she and Musk worry about,” Isaacson wrote in a tweet yesterday (August 7). “When Musk wanted to tweet a pun about it, he Google-searched to find an image, and he discovered that Grimes had made it an element of her 2015 music video ‘Flesh without Blood.’ She and Musk got into a Twitter exchange that led, in the modern way, to direct messaging and texting.” After getting to know each other better on Twitter, Musk invited Grimes to fly to Fremont, Calif. to visit the Tesla factory there: “his idea of a good date,” Isaacson wrote. “We just walked the floor all night, and I watched him try to fix things,” Grimes told the author. The next day, Musk drove Grimes to a restaurant for dinner. On their way, Musk closed his eyes, engaged Autopilot, Tesla’s driver-assist system, and let the car drive itself. “I was like, oh shit, this guy is fucking crazy,” Grimes told Isaacson of the experience. At the restaurant, Musk carved their initials, “EM+CB,” on the wall. In yesterday’s tweet, Isaacson posted a photo of the former couple and their son, X Æ A-Xii (pronounced “X Ash A Twelve”), at SpaceX’s Starbase test site on April 20, ahead of Starship’s first orbital launch attempt. Musk and Grimes have two known children together. The SpaceX CEO told Page Six in 2021 he and Grimes had separated but were on great terms. Over the weekend, Isaacson tweeted a photo of the interior of Elon Musk’s $50,000 house in Boca Chica, Texas, near SpaceX’s development facility and said that the upcoming book will explain why Musk chose to downsize from multiple mansions to a two-bedroom rental. Earlier last week, Isaacson tweeted the book also includes interviews with Musk’s brother, Kimbal, his father, Errol, his mother, Maye Musk, and his two former wives, Justine Musk and Talulah Riley.",

      "title": "Elon Musk responding to Bronny James is exactly what we can expect of Twitter now",
      "text": "We were all just reminded why Elon Musk’s ownership of Twitter, now rebranded X, is so poisonous to our discourse. Son of basketball legend LeBron James, 18-year-old Bronny James, suffered from cardiac arrest during a basketball workout. He was rushed to the hospital and, as of Tuesday afternoon, is in a stable condition. As we’ve come to see so commonly with sports stars and conditions like this, anti-vaccine conspiracy theories surged on social media, especially Twitter. The owner of the site couldn’t help but to join in. Elon Musk wasted no time immediately suggesting the Covid-19 vaccine could be to blame. Musk tweeted (or xeeted?): “We cannot ascribe everything to the vaccine, but, by the same token, we cannot ascribe nothing. Myocarditis is a known side-effect. The only question is whether it is rare or common.” Musk sent that post only 30 minutes after the first TMZ report on Bronny’s condition was released. He had zero information on what could have caused Bronny’s cardiac arrest, nor does he have any unique insight into Bronny’s potential pre-existing conditions. But Musk didn’t let his lack of evidence spread this anti-vaccine conspiracy theory. A simple “I wish Bronny a speedy recovery” would’ve sufficed. When it comes to Musk’s unsolicited and unsubstantiated theory, the data doesn’t suggest it is the most likely explanation. Developing myocarditis from a Covid-19 vaccine is rare. In fact, the American Heart Association published a 2022 analysis of nearly 43 million people which found that people are more likely to develop myocarditis from Covid-19 itself than from the vaccine. It’s also important to note that sudden cardiac arrests among young athletes are nothing new. In fact, in 2014, well before Covid-19 vaccines arrived, the NCAA convened a task force to evaluate cardiovascular care for their students. In 2016, the NCAA published a press release stating: “Sudden cardiac death is the most common nontraumatic cause of death among college athletes, and 75 percent of college student-athlete deaths occur during sports and exercise.” Now, I’m not saying that Bronny’s chances of having myocarditis from the vaccine are zero. Like Musk, I do not have any deeper insight into the inner workings of this sad, developing case. But I do look at reliably sourced data, which suggests the chances are very low. If he was keen to speculate, I couldn’t help but wonder why, if the available data shows you are in fact more likely to develop myocarditis from Covid-19 itself, Musk didn’t speculate Covid-19 that could have been the cause? Or why didn’t he speculate it may have been another sudden cardiac arrest suffered by a young athlete? The answer seems to be that Musk was seeking to echo anti-vaccine rhetoric. This intent would be unsurprising given Musk’s past proliferation of right-wing conspiracy theories, previous opposition to taking the Covid-19 vaccine, and his recent interview with anti-vax presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr. Anti-vaccine conspiracy theories have become central to far-right messaging, and this particular brand of disinformation has found a home on Musk’s Twitter. Immediately after Musk’s purchase of Twitter last November, reports indicated a rise of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories from the newly purchased $8 blue check accounts. Countless studies have shown an increase in misinformation on Twitter since Musk’s October 2022 purchase. Elon Musk has turned Twitter into a radicalization machine, and he shows no signs of changing course now. Rather than work to improve the platform’s problems, which have caused millions of people to flee to rival sites, Musk has instead focused on rebranding Twitter to “X.” Musk claims he will make X an “everything” app, similar to China’s WeChat - fully equipped with messaging, payments, shopping, and banking. But rebranding before any of those features are complete and amid rising distrust of the platform seems like a major risk, especially as so many of Musk’s other product pushes have failed. Bloomberg estimates this rebrand could wipe out anywhere from $4 billion to $20 billion in value. Who knows where this will leave the company, whose valuation was already lowered from $44 billion to $15 billion. Musk’s X rebrand was already risky enough by throwing away almost two decades of brand recognition any company would kill to have. “Tweet” is literally a verb in the dictionary. But it also looks like the move poses legal risks as well. It’s been discovered that Meta and Microsoft both own trademarks to X. In fact, Reuters reports that “nearly 900 active US trademark registrations that already cover the letter X in a wide range of industries.” On day two of the X rebrand, it looks like we’re in for more of the same from Musk’s social media platform - unhinged conspiracy theories being encouraged by the owner himself with absolutely no regard for the consequences. What a compelling sales pitch.",

Immediately after Musk’s purchase of Twitter last November, reports indicated a rise of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories from the newly purchased $8 blue check accounts. Countless studies have shown an increase in misinformation on Twitter since Musk’s October 2022 purchase. Elon Musk has turned Twitter into a radicalization machine, and he shows no signs of changing course now. Rather than work to improve the platform’s problems, which have caused millions of people to flee to rival sites, Musk has instead focused on rebranding Twitter to “X.” Musk claims he will make X an “everything” app, similar to China’s WeChat - fully equipped with messaging, payments, shopping, and banking. But rebranding before any of those features are complete and amid rising distrust of the platform seems like a major risk, especially as so many of Musk’s other product pushes have failed. Bloomberg estimates this rebrand could wipe out anywhere from $4 billion to $20 billion in value. Who knows where this will leave the company, whose valuation was already lowered from $44 billion to $15 billion. Musk’s X rebrand was already risky enough by throwing away almost two decades of brand recognition any company would kill to have. “Tweet” is literally a verb in the dictionary. But it also looks like the move poses legal risks as well. It’s been discovered that Meta and Microsoft both own trademarks to X. In fact, Reuters reports that “nearly 900 active US trademark registrations that already cover the letter X in a wide range of industries.” On day two of the X rebrand, it looks like we’re in for more of the same from Musk’s social media platform - unhinged conspiracy theories being encouraged by the owner himself with absolutely no regard for the consequences. What a compelling sales pitch.",

      "title": "See inside Elon Musk's $50,000 house, thanks to this rare photo posted by his biographer",
      "text": "Walter Isaacson shared a sneak peek inside Elon Musk's $50,000 house.The photo shows Musk's kitchen and a portion of his living room.The billionaire said in 2020 he plans to \"own no home\" and later said he rents a house from SpaceX. Walter Isaacson gave people a glimpse into Elon Musk's $50,000 home on Sunday. \"In 2020, Musk decided to sell his five grand houses and to have as his primary residence this spartan two-bedroom house in Boca Chica, TX, where we would meet and he would sit at this wood table and make phone calls,\" Isaacson, who shadowed Musk for the better part of three years, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. The biographer said he will explain why Musk decided to sell his other houses in his book on the billionaire, which will come out on September 12. The billionaire has said in the past that he wants to sell his belongings in order to help fund his plans to one day build a colony on Mars. The photo appears to show Musk's kitchen and a portion of his living room at his house near SpaceX's launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. In the picture from Isaacson, Musk appears to have a katana sword on his coffee table, as well as some sort of rocket-shaped object or sculpture, and what appear to be a handful of games. A Tesla \"Plaid Mode\" jacket, which Musk has been photographed wearing before, hangs on a chair. The billionaire, who is a sci-fi enthusiast, also has a poster for a science fiction pulp magazine called \"Amazing Stories\" displayed prominently over his kitchen table. Here's a better look at the poster on his wall, a print of which is currently listed on Posterazzi.com for $32.83. The cover art depicts Henry Gade's sci-fi story, \"Liners of Space,\" with artwork showing mass transportation spaceships — reminiscent of Elon Musk's grand plans for SpaceX's Starship rocket, which he has said he wants to eventually use to ferry people to and from Mars. It's not the first time we've caught a sneak peek of Musk's private life. Last year, the Tesla CEO shared a photo of what appeared to be his bedside table on X — the photo included several cans of caffeine-free Diet Coke and what appeared to be two replica guns. In 2020, Musk announced that he was \"selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house.\" Weeks later, five of his homes were listed for sale on Zillow. Musk sold his last house for $30 million in 2021 after he said he'd begun renting a house in Texas from SpaceX that cost $50,000. Insider previously reported that a Boxabl pre-fabricated house called a \"Casita\" had been delivered to SpaceX. At the time, Musk denied living in the modular house, saying that he lives in a different small house in Texas. But in July 2022, he said on a podcast that he owns a Boxabl and uses it as a guest house. Musk's current accommodations appear to be less ostentatious than some of his previous houses, where the billionaire had been known to host lavish parties, including a Gatsby-themed event. In 2020, Kanye West, one of Musk's longtime acquaintances, shared a photo from inside one of Musk's houses. The photo showed the two men in what appeared to be a large room in front of a glass wall that encased a life-sized replica of a robot. The billionaire is also believed to be in the process of building another house for himself in Texas, according to reports from The Wall Street Journal. Last month, the publication reported that a Tesla project that led to an internal review at the company could be a glass house for Musk. Earlier this year, the Journal reported that Musk was building a company town called \"Snailbrook\" in Texas and had plans to create a private compound for himself on the premises.

      "title": "Don’t let the Zuckerberg-Musk cagefight nonsense distract from the real issues",
      "text": "Few things in the history of technology have crushed the very fibres of my being as severely as the announcement this week that the Elon Musk/Mark Zuckerberg cage fight is off. I jest, of course. Is there any more mind-numbingly stupid ongoing tech industry “story” in any Metaverse, universe, or galaxy full of guardians (as if any would ever feature either Zuckerberg or Musk among the superhero line-up)? Who but Elon fanboys did anything but laugh out loud at the idea of a Musk-Zuckerberg cage fight? Bitter mirth, followed swiftly by a terrifying mental image of what such a fight might involve in terms of tech billionaire spandex and/or shorts. If ever there were a TMI moment in tech, that was it for me. But seriously (okay, I accept that ‘seriously’ is the wrong word choice here). How did this ridiculous social media wittering – surely always a joke between tech bros – get taken as an actual story to be followed breathlessly by media outlets? At least the latest update comes during the bona fide August silly season, but this started months ago and has been covered by the media as if it would ever be an actual thing. To watch the personification of two struggling social networks and poor business decisions duke it out – and mixed martial arts (MMA) rules allow bare-fisted punches to the face – is the perfect recipe for being owned by a visual metaphor. It’s the equivalent of politicians agreeing to the kind of woeful photo opportunity that makes them look so ridiculous that it immediately deflates their election prospects. This would be comical in the actual meaning of the word. But so dumb, so lame that no one would ever cosplay cage-fight-Zuckerberg or cage-fight-Musk at ComicCon except as an ironic joke. [ Proposed cage fight now seems unlikely between giants of the tech world ] At first, when Musk challenged Zuckerberg (oh yes, of course it had to be Musk, the man that apparently has so little to do in real life that he thinks up this stuff), I assumed we’d all laugh joylessly and move on to, say, looking at Twitter’s bottom line or running-on-empty staffing or bitcoin- selling blue tick boyos and wonder what else Musk had on his mind. By “we”, here, I mean the media. But alas, no. In the time since, story after story has covered each additional social media post relating to the cage fight as if Zuckerberg and Musk were saying something of significance about corporate financials or strategy or anything remotely newsworthy. Covering the back and forth between the two might be fine if reported in a tone expressing a gigantic eye roll, but no – each new instalment, from syndicated news agencies to major media organisations, has been to take each utterance as seriously as a company earnings report. Even when the latest update is as mind-numbingly boneheaded as Musk suggesting a practice fight in Zuckerberg’s backyard, and another pushing Italy and the Colosseum as a perfect “epic” setting for this jackassery. Instead of just sighing in exasperation that this exchange is still going on, and on, and on, instead there are further serious pieces about whether Musk ever intended to fight and how Zuckerberg, who does martial arts (WHO CARES!? Honestly! Who. Actually. Cares) has tried to schedule it. A fight would be silly. It’s so high school and banal. Whatever Elon is doing here is far removed from his immediate tasks— Musk senior For crying out loud. And yes, I’m at that point. Does anyone think either of them ever intended to engage in a cage fight? That the boring social media post back and forth was ever anything more than the billionaire verbal sparring equivalent of the stale sense of humour both have demonstrated in the past? But wait. In an ending perfectly suited to this tedious, juvenile episode, Elon Musk’s father – his FATHER – has now had enough and stepped in, like some exasperated dad retrieving his son from the headmaster’s office after being suspended for lying and irritating behaviour in class. Dad Errol Musk told the US edition of the Sun what every journalist writing about this should have recognised from the start: that the whole thing was Elon drawing some attention to flailing Twitter/ X (duh) and was a “high school”-ish publicity stunt. “A fight would be silly. It’s so high school and banal. Whatever Elon is doing here is far removed from his immediate tasks,” said Musk senior. Finally, an adult in the room! Maybe Zuck, Musk, and journalists everywhere are at last ready to graduate from high school to attend the University of the Bleeding Obvious. But I can’t believe we actually needed a dad intervention to, one prays, bring this pathetic episode to a close. Meanwhile, I am going to spend the rest of August repeating my new mantra, “oh please let the cage fight trash talk be over, oh please let the cage flight trash talk be over” until summer ends and we move on to the real cage fight: the autumn quarterly financial earnings reports from certain social media companies.",

      "title": "Elon Musk  wooed Grimes with high-speed Autopilot ride while eyes closed,  new tell-all reveals: 'This guy is f---ing crazy'",
      "text": "Elon Musk took Grimes on a wild ride while courting the Canadian singer that included driving hands-free with his eyes closed to show off his Tesla’s Autopilot feature, according to excerpts from an upcoming tell-all about the tech mogul. The infatuated billionaire invited the “spellbinding performing artist” to dinner after the two connected online in 2018, writes biographer Walter Isaacson, who offered a sneak peak of the book on Musk’s platform X. “While driving her to a restaurant, he showed how fast the car accelerated, then took his hands off the wheel, covered his eyes, and let her experience Autopilot,” wrote Isaacson, who was allowed to shadow Musk for over a year. “I was like, oh sh-t, this guy is f–king crazy,” Grimes told Isaacson, who referred to their whirlwind relationship as a “chaotic new subplot.” Their rocky three-year romance also began with Musk giving Grimes a pop quiz about the “Lord of the Rings” and the singer gifting the man who has everything with a box of animal bones, writes Isaacson. The two had met a year earlier when Musk was in an elevator with then-girlfriend Amber Heard before the two broke up in 2018, according to Isaacson’s upcoming book, due out Sept. 12, The single Tesla boss reached out, ironically on the platform formerly known as Twitter that he now owns, after learning of their shared interest in Roko’s basilisk — a thought experiment that theorizes that artificial intelligence will lead to an all-powerful being that will torture anyone who doesn’t assist in its creation. Musk and Grimes spent their first date at his Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif. “We just walked the floor all night, and I watched him try to fix things,” Grimes told the author, who has also written bios of Steve Jobs and Benjamin Franklin. The courtship continued the next day as Musk picked the singer up for dinner in his Tesla. Grimes compared Musk’s powers to Gandalf, the wizardly protagonist in JRR Tolkein’s “Lord of the Rings,” which prompted Musk to give Grimes a rapid-fire trivia test on the epic tale, according to Isaacson. “She passed,” Isaacson wrote. “That mattered to me,” Musk, 52, noted. As a gift, Grimes, 35, told Isaacson that she gave Musk a box of animal bones she had collected. Isaacson’s excerpt also revealed that the lovers listened to an hour of history podcasts and audiobooks before bed. The duo went on to have two children together — a baby boy named X Æ A-12 Musk, who was born in May 2020 and his parents simply refer to as X, and a girl named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, who they welcomed via surrogate in December 2021. Grimes and Musk split in September 2021, before Exa Dark, whom they call Y, was born. However, they reportedly reconnected after the birth of their baby girl. Last March, Grimes tweeted: “Me and E have broken up *again*.” “He’s my best friend and the love of my life, and my life and art are forever dedicated to The Mission now,” she added. With X and Y, Musk is a father to nine children with three different women. After marrying in January 2000, Musk and Canadian author Justine Wilson welcomed son Nevada Alexander Musk in 2002. Nevada died of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, at only 10 weeks. Musk and Wilson then used IVF to have twins Griffin and Vivian Musk, who are now 18. The former couple also used IVF to welcome triplet sons Kai, Saxon and Damian in January 2006. The trio are now 16. Musk also quietly welcomed twins with Neuralink director of operations and special projects Shivon Zilis in November 2021, according to court documents obtained by Business Insider in July 2022.",

      "title": "Elon Musk, self-described &#8216;free speech absolutist,&#8217; sues nonprofit over its speech",
      "text": "Elon Musk, owner of the company formerly called Twitter and an avowed crusader for free speech, this week followed through on a threat and sued a nonprofit over its statements criticizing his firm, now called X. The lawsuit targets allegations by the Center for Countering Digital Hate that hate speech spiked at X in the week after Musk bought it in October, with users tweeting tens of thousands of anti-Black, anti-trans, anti-gay and antisemitic slurs, increases of 23% to 300% over 2022 averages. The lawsuit accused the nonprofit of “a scare campaign to drive away advertisers from the X platform.” The nonprofit used “flawed methodology” by focusing only on the number of tweets and retweets of the slurs and not on how many times they were viewed, X’s lawsuit filed late Monday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco alleged. During the week after Musk’s takeover, he claimed in a tweet, “we have actually seen hateful speech at times this week decline *below* our prior norms, contrary to what you may read in the press.” Shortly after that first week ended, the company’s head of trust and safety Yoel Roth claimed in a tweet that X had “mitigated the recent surge in harmful behavior” and cut the views of such content by around 95%. Roth’s tweet included a chart showing a purported sharp decline in views of slur-containing tweets within a few days of Musk buying the firm. The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit claimed the statements from Musk and Roth did not match the data. The Center for Countering Digital Hate is not the only entity to identify purported increases in hate speech at X after Musk took over. The day after Musk completed his $44 billion purchase of the company on October 27, the Associated Press reported that “dozens of extremist profiles — some newly created — circulated racial slurs and Nazi imagery while expressing gratitude to Musk for his new leadership.” In April, researchers from the University of Southern California, UCLA and other universities published a paper that concluded, based on tweets from around a month before Musk bought the company to a month after, that “hateful users employed more hate speech following Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter,” and, “the overall presence of hateful tweets increased.” The paper warned that hate speech could lead to “offline victimization of targeted groups.” The USC business school recently published a “Social Media Index” based on survey results, which showed that between March 2 and May 7, Twitter led all U.S.-based social media in adult users who saw content “bad for the world.” Musk has touted X as a haven for free speech, and referred to himself as a “free speech absolutist.” Under his ownership, the social media site has relaxed moderation standards and drawn fire over a number of controversies including reinstating an account last week that had posted images of sexual abuse of a child, and over the past weekend reinstating the account of Kanye West, who was banned in December for tweeting a Nazi swastika inside a Jewish Star of David. The platform has also reinstated far-right influencer Andrew Tate — awaiting trial in Romania on charges that he denies of rape, human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women — and Andrew Anglin, neo-Nazi founder of the Daily Stormer website. Advertisers have fled the platform, with Musk saying in March that ad revenue had dropped 50%. In May, Fidelity Investments marked down its stake in the company, valuing X at a third of what Musk paid for it. The Center for Countering Digital Hate followed up on the November report with several more. In June, the nonprofit claimed that Twitter failed to act on tweets from subscribers — whose tweets are prioritized for viewing, according to Musk — that contained racist, homophobic, neo-Nazi and antisemitic content. “Our society has benefited from decades of progress on tolerance, but Elon Musk is undoing those norms at an ever-accelerating rate … with the tacit approval of the advertisers who remain on his platform,” the nonprofit claimed. In March, the group alleged that since Musk took over, tweets and retweets linking the LGBTQ+ community to pedophilia jumped 119%. Last month, a lawyer for X in a letter to the nonprofit attacked its allegations about subscribers’ tweets as “little more than a series of inflammatory, misleading, and unsupported claims based on a cursory review of random tweets.” The attorney, Alex Spiro, accused the group of trying “to harm Twitter’s business by driving advertisers away” and said his office was looking into a possible lawsuit. Lawyers for the nonprofit responded in a letter to Spiro calling his missive “a disturbing effort to intimidate those who have the courage to advocate against incitement, hate speech and harmful content online.” The Center for Countering Digital Hate on Tuesday called the lawsuit “straight out of the authoritarian playbook,” and said Musk was “showing he will stop at nothing to silence anyone who criticizes him for his own decisions and actions.”",

      "title": "Do rebrands work? Can you trademark an X? An expert answers the burning questions on Musk's Twitter pivot",
      "text": "To non-moguls, Elon Musk’s (perhaps temporary) rebrand of Twitter to “X” may seem high risk, amateurish, or even capricious. But it is likely doing exactly what he intended: generating enormous global interest, pushing Twitter closer to his other X brands (SpaceX, Tesla Model X, xAI), and clearing the way for a profitable merging of technologies. What happened to the blue bird? Last weekend, Musk began the (reversible) changes by renaming the Twitter platform X on its website and replacing the iconic blue bird logo with a crowdsourced “interim” white “X” on a black background. Later, Musk posted an image of the character projected on the firm’s San Francisco headquarters and tweeted (or is that “X’d”?) that x.com now redirects to twitter.com. The X bears a strong resemblance to the Unicode character “mathematical double-struck capital X”, derived from the way bold characters are usually written on blackboards in maths lectures. The logo is still undergoing iterations, with a short-lived thickening of the lines going live on July 26, before Musk announced he didn’t like it and would revert. Linda Yaccarino, Twitter’s CEO and potential scapegoat if the rebrand goes wrong, also confirmed the launch on Sunday, tweeting, “X is here! Let’s do this.” Read more: Elon Musk's 'hardcore' management style: a case study in what not to do Has a radical rebrand ever succeeded? In 2021, Facebook rebranded its holding company to Meta. But it kept “Facebook”, gave us the metaverse, and didn’t deprive the world of a cute feathery icon and concept of “tweeting”. Branding experts around the globe have been quick to condemn the Twitter shakeup as too sudden and destructive of brand capital. That’s perhaps because even slight name changes are known to be risky. Kentucky Fried Chicken officially rebranded to KFC. Pepsi was once Pepsi-Cola. These successful adjustments took time and careful management. Dramatic renaming of a household name has basically never worked. And there’s no doubt a black “X” replacing “Twitter” is dramatic. It smashes the metaphor of birds updating one another in an idyllic blue-sky ecosystem. Sentimental fans holding out for a return to the good old days have now got the memo: Twitter isn’t for you. But perhaps that’s the point. To me, X – a symbol that can be a cattle marker or an illiterate signature – seems like a probe to perturb and test the market. Musk isn’t renaming fast food or soft drinks. Twitter is in the hyper-dynamic business of information. Musk is agile and well armed. So maybe new branding rules are being forged. Musk’s progressive alienation of Twitter’s traditional users could be an attempt to refresh the platform’s demographic – to draw in those true to his other brands, while shaking off unprofitable sceptics. This would certainly fit with the push X gives towards Musk’s other X brands. Most commentators have latched onto the idea the change is sudden, irreversible, and complete in one day. But Musk’s past business endeavours suggest he is a strategist. The change will take time to play out and can likely be revised, reversed and adjusted as feedback is generated. Read more: What will Elon Musk's ownership of Twitter mean for 'free speech' on the platform? Doesn’t someone else own the “X” trademark? Trademarking of “X” is probably not pivotal to the Twitter rebrand. But achieving limited ownership of the letter is not as preposterous as it sounds. Trademarks are granted or refused based on their ability to identify the source of the associated goods or services. This means X can function as a trademark if it clearly identifies Twitter in the minds of the public (provided another Twitter-like service doesn’t currently hold the trademark). Famous brands have advantages: Musk has already garnered enough media attention to ensure X is now a globally recognised term for his company. Is X a generic term and thus not trademarkable? My own research argues trademarks used by tech firms involved in consumer search and decision making (like Twitter) are inherently generic. But under the 77-year-old Lanham Act that still governs trademarks in the United States, X would have to be a common generic name for all services like Twitter to be refused. It isn’t. It’s mostly just a generic term for the 24th letter of the alphabet. Speculation about the legality of X as a trademark is one thing. My time writing about trademarks, has taught me the reality in courts and tribunals is another. Both Microsoft and Meta (and many others) have laid claims to X in the past for various goods and services. Lawsuits over X may be filed, but final determinations could be years in the courts. And if things go badly, Musk has just shown his willingness to pivot. Read more: The 'digital town square'? What does it mean when billionaires own the online spaces where we gather? What is Musk trying to achieve? Tech commentators are intrigued by the idea the X rebrand is part of Musk’s plan to create a WeChat-style “everything app” that would converge messaging, search, online shopping and mobile payment. Twitter CEO, Yaccarino, has said as much. I find that analysis too simplistic, especially given the ongoing focus on antitrust. Musk is arguably in a position to survey (and reshape) the landscape of not just “town square” discourse but space travel, artificial intelligence (AI), transportation and even politics. He operates on a scale incompatible with endgames. I sense the X rebrand is more about a direction of travel. Or even a sacrifice for a greater goal. The X rebrand could relate to AI (Musk had a role in a data drought this year by restricting Twitter data access). Or it could be testing the waters for a different pivot later in the year. Or it could be an attempt to distract from some other move. There’s no way to know. Even the phrase “time will tell” is no help. How can we know if an unknown plan succeeds or not? Does Musk care if Twitter disappears? Does he care if he is worth two hundred billion or three hundred billion? Welcome to the inscrutable world of X.",

      "title": "Elon Musk's 'Silly' Dogecoin Tweets Are Dragging Out Insider Trading Lawsuit, Lawyers Say",
      "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s attorneys argued on Monday that the billionaire’s legal battle with a group of disgruntled Dogecoin investors has dragged on for too long. Musk’s counsel asked for the plaintiff’s revised complaint to be dismissed, according to a filing submitted in a New York federal court. In a letter supporting the dismissal, Musk lawyer Alex Shapiro skewered the lawsuit’s latest complaint submitted on behalf of Dogecoin investors. “Enough is enough,” Shapiro wrote. “This action is yet another example of counsel’s abusive and belligerent litigation tactics.” Evan Spencer, the lead attorney in the class-action lawsuit against Musk, amended the lawsuit’s complaint for a third time in June, tacking on additional allegations. The lawsuit, which initially sought $258 billion in damages when filed last June, accuses Musk of “a deliberate course of carnival barking, market manipulation, and insider trading” when it comes to one of crypto’s most iconic meme coins. Musk’s enthusiasm for Dogecoin has been well-documented over the years since his initial Tweet that “Dogecoin may be [his] fav cryptocurrency” in April 2019, and it’s only continued since his acquisition of Twitter last year. The Tesla CEO’s latest high-profile moment involving Dogecoin took place around (but not on) April Fools Day when Twitter’s logo was temporarily replaced with Dogecoin’s Shiba Inu mascot. In the amended complaint, Spenser notes the switch took place shortly after Musk’s counsel sought to dismiss the lawsuit in March and led Dogecoin to rally 30%. In 2021, Dogecoin pumped to dizzying heights ahead of Musk’s appearance on NBC’s Saturday Night Live only for Dogecoin to buckle after he called it a hustle on the late-night comedy show. Still, Musk’s counsel says any Dogecoin “cheerleading” their client has done over the years amounts to “quintessential, inactionable puffery.” “There is nothing unlawful about tweeting words of support for, or funny pictures about, a cryptocurrency,” Musk’s counsel wrote in Monday’s motion, deriding the amended complaint as “fanciful, meandering, and often incomprehensible.” Musk’s lawyers stated the lawsuit’s claims fail to hold up under scrutiny because allegations rest on Dogecoin sold by digital wallets that are not factually tied to Musk or Tesla. Additionally, Musk’s lawyers claim the lawsuit fails to demonstrate Musk’s comments about Dogecoin were materially false or misleading. In June, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who oversees the case, set a deadline for Musk’s lawyers to respond to the amended complaint by Monday. In terms of filing their opposition to the motion for dismissal, attorneys representing Dogecoin investors have until early September. As June progressed, the legal battle took an acrimonious turn. Spencer accused Musk’s legal team of engaging in “dirty tactics” after an article in the New York Post cited a letter written by Musk lawyer Alex Spiro. Asking for several of Musk’s lawyers to be removed from the case, Spencer alleged it was an attempt to “materially prejudice” the lawsuit. “It appears defendants are using their bottomless war chest to finance an unlawful harassment campaign against me and my clients,” Spencer wrote in a subsequent filing. Musk’s lawyers shot back and called the request to remove counsel an “insult,” adding that allegations Spiro leaked the derogatory letter were baseless. They said that it was actually Spencer who was acting inappropriately and his allegations were “so improper that Spencer’s Motion itself [was] sanctionable.”",

      "title": "Why would Elon Musk lash out at James Woods, of all people?",
      "text": "Even though James Woods was one of Elon Musk’s biggest celebrity supporters when the Tesla CEO took over the social media site formerly known as Twitter, Musk showed that he wasn’t so inclined to reciprocate the actor’s good will and gracefully accept his criticism of his pledge to remove the platform’s “block” option. Musk, apparently being Musk, told Woods to “delete your account.” Musk then hit “block” on Woods — the very button the two men had been arguing about, the Daily Beast reported. Perhaps being thin-skinned, Musk didn’t take too kindly to Woods calling him a “greedy capitalist” and dismissing his claims of being a defender of free speech. “Musk, whom I once championed, is only doing this to protect his advertisers anyway,” Woods said on X Saturday about the proposal to end the “block” feature. “Users of X are mere pawns to turn the site into an electronic shopping mall. The man I thought was a defender of free speech is just another greedy capitalist. Disappointing, but not surprising.” After Musk blocked Woods, the actor wrote, “(Your) prerogative, sir, which is exactly my point. Have a nice day.” You prerogative, sir, which is exactly my point. Have a nice day. pic.twitter.com/qt8ZD3wbM9 — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) August 20, 2023 It’s hard to gauge why Musk so cavalierly lashed out at a celebrity fan who has 3.4 million followers and who shares many of his conservative, anti-woke sensibilities. One X user called Musk’s move “bizarro,” but Musk also likes to play provocateur and is “ever a bundle of contradictions and inconsistencies,” as the New York Times once said. As the New York Post and the Daily Beast reported, Musk and Woods began arguing on X Friday after Musk mused on the possibility of removing the block button and Woods disparaged this plan. Doing so, the double-Oscar nominee said, would make the site “untenable” for public figures such as himself. “In the midst of a libel suit I was targeted by 30 trolls the defendant enlisted to harass me,” Woods wrote in an X post on Saturday. “X will be untenable for people like me, who are willing to share their identities. If he does this, I will have no choice but to retire from this site.” When a supporter of Woods responded to the post, writing that “we got to make sure that doesn’t happen. You’re one of the most important people on here,” Woods responded, “If @elonmuskremoves the ability to block concerted harassment by trolls or organized political entities, how will ‘X’ be any different from Jack Dorsey’s horrid Twitter?” After Woods confirmed that Musk blocked him, he expressed gratitude to his supporters and insisted that he didn’t really plan to go anywhere. “The recurring theme in your many heartfelt DM’s was a fear that I would leave X,” Woods told his followers. “I’ve have now decided I will never leave, and will only ever be silent when they find an excuse to remove my account.” Woods also said he had “battled the oppressive boot of censorship before, and will continue until the Stasi at X find an excuse to bury me for good.” Woods is no doubt referring to the times he was suspended or blocked from Twitter when he posted politically-themed messages that were said to be misleading or tinged with conspiracy theories and in violation of the platform’s terms of service, Newsweek reported. For this so-called battle against “the oppressive boot” of Musk’s censorship, Woods received support from people in divergent political circles. Some were Musk fans, the New York Post reported. “This is a huge mistake,” the pro-Musk X account known as “Wall Street Silver” wrote. “Block is a critical feature on this app. … There are certain evil people that users just don’t want following them or replying to them. Scammers, cyber stalkers, etc. I suspect many people would abandon X if they can’t block the harassing accounts out of their lives.” From a different perspective, Monica Lewinsky also wrote about the dangers of removing the block feature: “Please rethink removing the block feature. as an anti-bullying activist (and target of harassment) i can assure you it’s a critical tool to keep people safe online.” Musk responded to his critics on Sunday with taunts, writing that it was “pretty fun blocking people who complain that blocking is going away.” But X users in turn by responded by saying that Musk would essentially be shooting himself in the foot. They wrote “a community note” — which allows posters to offer clarifications and corrections on content that could be misleading — which states that doing away with the “block” feature could be a violation of the terms of service of Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store,” the New York Post said.",

      "title": "\"Modern Day Bruce Lee\" : Elon Musk To Mark Zuckerberg On Cage Fight",
      "text": "Billionaire Elon Musk took to X, formerly Twitter, to share a screenshot of his conversation with Mark Zuckerberg on the much-anticipated cage fight. In the text exchange, Mr Musk is seen taunting the latter about the differences in their physical stature. He wrote, \"While I think it's very unlikely, given our size difference, perhaps you're modern-day Bruce Lee and will somehow win.\" This is the full message: pic.twitter.com/UzbKoIkFOc— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 13, 2023 Mr Musk first leaked the exchange to his biographer, Walter Isaacson who also posted a screenshot of the text exchange on Twitter. According to the screenshot shared by Mr Isaacson, Mr Musk asked Mr Zuckerberg if they can \"practice bout\". Mr Zuckerberg seemed annoyed and replied, \"If you still want to do a real MMA fight, then you should train on your own and let me know when you're ready to compete,\" Zuckerberg wrote, per Musk's record of the exchange. I don't want to keep hyping something that will never happen, so you should either decide you're going to do this and do it soon, or we should move on.\" Mr Musk replied that he \"will be in Palo Alto on Monday.\" \"I have not been practicing much, apart from a brief bout with Lex Fridman today,\" Musk told Zuckerberg, per the screenshot. \"While I think it is very unlikely, given our size difference, perhaps you are a modern day Bruce Lee and will somehow win,\" he added. Mr Musk's reply comes after Meta founder wrote it's \"time to move on\" from speculation that there will be a cage fight match between him and Elon Musk. \"I think we can all agree Elon isn't serious and it's time to move on. I offered a real date. Dana White offered to make this a legit competition for charity. Elon won't confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead. If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me. Otherwise, time to move on. I'm going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously,\" Mr Zuckerberg posted on Threads. The public rivalry between Mr Musk, 52, and Mr Zuckerberg, 39, intensified after the initial success of Meta's Threads social media platform in July. Threads, which allows users to post short blurbs in a similar fashion to X, the Musk-owned platform formerly known as Twitter, reached 100 million users within a week of its launch.",

      "title": "Zuck v. Musk and Other Famous Feuds in Web3 History",
      "text": "In just the last two years, Web3 has been on a rollercoaster ride of fortune. Hailed as the future of the internet as well as the crypto and blockchain spaces all at once, Web3 had a difficult set of expectations to meet even from the beginning. By the summer of 2023, many prominent voices inside and outside of the Web3 space have criticized the project heavily. One popular website, “Web3 is Going Just Great,” purports to keep a running total of all of the scams and fraud in the crypto space with a “Grift Counter.” As of August 2, 2023, the counter totals about $67.8 billion in fraud. There are many reasons why detractors of Web3 can argue that the project is not yet successful. These range from the fraud above to a widespread decline in venture capital heading toward Web3-focused companies to problems with project utility to wild swings in the crypto market and much more. In such a turbulent world that is dominated by strong personalities and potentially large sums of speculative cash flying around, it’s perhaps to be expected that high-profile feuds and fights will develop. Some may argue that these battles do nothing to help Web3 overcome its many hurdles—and, in fact, that they may exacerbate some of the problems that critics point to. In this list, we look at the top five most famous feuds in Web3 history. 1. Elon Musk vs. Mark Zuckerberg Undoubtedly the most high-profile feud in the Web3 (or Web3-adjacent) space is the ongoing tension between Tesla CEO and owner of X (formerly Twitter) Elon Musk and Meta (formerly Facebook) founder Mark Zuckerberg. Musk and Zuckerberg are among the wealthiest people on the planet (Forbes places them at #1 and #7, respectively, as of this writing), and they both have legions of fans as well as scores of detractors. Their fighting also pre-dates the Web3 project by many years. In the fall of 2016, a $200-million satellite built by Zuckerberg exploded in an pre-launch accident on a rocket for SpaceX, another of Musk’s companies. Zuckerberg pinned the blame on Musk’s company, writing on Facebook at the time that “SpaceX’s launch failure destroyed our satellite.” Zuckerberg took another shot at Musk the next year, when he commented on artificial intelligence “naysayers” as being “irresponsible.” Though he didn’t mention Musk by name, the billionaire was widely seen as the primary target of Zuckerberg’s comment. Indeed, Musk took to Twitter to respond, calling Zuckerberg’s understanding of artificial intelligence “limited.” The popular site “Web3 is Going Just Great” keeps a “Grift Counter.” Musk escalated in 2018 when he publicly joined the “Delete Facebook” movement following the company’s political scandal with Cambridge Analytica. Both SpaceX and Tesla deleted their official Facebook pages. He has never reinstated official pages for either company. Musk went on in later years to call Facebook “lame,” urging followers to delete their accounts, and blaming Facebook for the events of January 6th, 2021 in Washington, D.C. After Musk purchased Twitter in 2022, Zuckerberg seemed to make an attempt to bring the temperature down. The latter executive praised Musk’s early handling of Twitter, saying Musk’s decision to lay off a substantial portion of Twitter’s staff was “probably good for the industry.” However, any potential calming of the waters did not last long. Twitter advertisers have left the platform in droves since Musk took over leadership, opening up space for rivals to assert dominance. Meta Platforms recently launched Threads, designed as a direct rival to Twitter, and Musk escalated the rhetoric with Zuckerberg. Following the news of Threads’ launch, Musk tweeted “I’m sure Earth can’t wait to be exclusively under Zuck’s thumb.” Musk even floated the idea of a “cage match” between the two; Zuckerberg responded seriously, saying “send me location.” Musk didn’t back down: “Vegas Octagon” was his response. There was even a famous shirtless photo produced as part of the sparring. This back-and-forth heated up through June of 2023. As of this writing, no public plans for a real cage match have been announced, but neither has there been any apparent ceasefire between the two billionaires. 2. Vitalik Buterin vs. Craig Wright Craig Wright is a polarizing figure in the crypto world. He’s the self-proclaimed inventor of Bitcoin—developed by a pseudonymous figure or figures known as “Satoshi Nakamoto”—who is known for being particularly litigious. In fact, he launched five separate lawsuits against prominent figures in the cryptocurrency community who all publicly questioned Wright’s claims of creating the most famous crypto of all. Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, was the most high-profile target of Wright’s lawsuits. At Deconomy 2018 in Seoul, South Korea, Buterin asked why a “fraud” was allowed to speak at the conference, referring to Wright. Buterin followed that question up with a public repository of links to materials from cryptocurrency experts supporting the assertion that Wright is not, in fact, Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright’s lawyers asked Buterin to retract his comments and apologize. When Buterin didn’t meet their request, Wright’s legal team then served a formal writ against Ethereum’s developer in the U.K. What happened next is somewhat unclear. According to Buterin, Wright allowed the time limit to expire without following up on the lawsuit, and nothing happened. Wright says, though, that Buterin declined to respond to the letter, effectively denying the lawsuit due to discrepancies in libel laws between the U.K. and other parts of the world. The feud has continued more recently as well, as Wright has sought to codify his legal status as Satoshi and Buterin has continued to lash out, calling Wright a “not very intellectual” person, among other comments. 3. Roger Ver vs. Everyone Roger Ver is sometimes referred to as “Bitcoin Jesus” for his early and outspoken support of the nascent cryptocurrency. However, in more recent years he has become a target of enmity from many in the crypto world. A primary reason for this is Ver’s shifting beliefs about bitcoin, which have led to some strong and potentially misleading statements, among other provocations. Ver’s view of bitcoin shifted after the early days of the coin. He came to see Bitcoin Cash, forked from the original bitcoin, as a token that adhered more closely to the original vision of the cryptocurrency. Fundamentally, Ver would like the bitcoin blocksize to be increased immediately in order to reduce transaction fees. This view has led Ver to voice his support for several other crypto tokens in addition to or before his support for Bitcoin Cash. The “Bitcoin Jesus” has advocated for Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited at various times, among other tokens. Ver’s detractors claim that he makes misleading statements about these coins. Ver has also complained about what he views as excessive censorship on the /r/bitcoin subreddit. Additionally, he owns the website bitcoin.com, which some critics have said pushes “propaganda” for Ver’s own pet projects and goals. But perhaps the biggest reason of all why many in the crypto space dislike Ver is that he has allegedly defaulted on multiple loans, including to the crypto broker Genesis and trading platform CoinFLEX. Even Craig Wright has pursued legal action against Ver. 4. Justin Sun vs. Ethereum Community Justin Sun is the founder of the TRON Network, a blockchain that can run smart contracts. He is known for pushing the initial coin offering of Tron’s crypto token, TRX, in China just days before the Chinese government banned ICOs, and then for having left the country. Some have speculated that Sun was aware the ban was coming and went ahead with the ICO anyway, despite knowing that it might be harmful to early adopters of the new token. Sun has also been accused of insider trading and market making activities. Sun’s business tactics may be catching up with him—in March of 2023 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was charging Sun and his companies for fraud and securities law violations. Besides his activities surrounding his own companies and crypto tokens, Sun has drawn the ire of members of the Ethereum community as well. Sun has reportedly redeemed tens of millions of dollars worth of staked Ether from the liquid staking platform Lido. He is the largest holder of staked Ether, with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens accounted for. Still, redeeming even a portion of those tokens could send the price of staked Ether away from the price of Ether, causing trouble for investors in both areas.",

      "title": "Biographer Walter Isaacson Discusses Elon Musk&#8217;s Leadership Style and Role Model",
      "text": "Elon Musk loves studying the history of wars for leadership insights. The Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO looks up to French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte as a role model, Musk’s biographer Walter Isaacson revealed in an interview published today (August 14). “He likes military history, and he believes there are lessons that apply to corporate life,” Isaacson told Axios cofounder Mike Allen. Musk likes learning from World War I history, in particular, Isaacson said, adding one of Musk’s favorite resources is Dan Carlin’s “Hardcore History” podcast. In an interview with Isaacson for the book, Musk’s former girlfriend, Grimes, said she and Musk used to “listen to an hour of war history before bed.” Musk “believes that wherever Napoleon was, that’s where his armies would do best. So he liked to show up late at night on the assembly lines at Tesla and SpaceX,” Isaacson said. In Isaacson’s forthcoming book, Elon Musk, which hits bookstores on Sept. 12, Musk recalled that one time he spent an hour supervising the construction of a Starship rocket booster at SpaceX’s development site in Boca Chica, Texas. Musk, the CEO of at least five companies, wanted to be there because “if they see their general on the battlefield, they will be more motivated,” he told Isaacson. “I learned that by reading about Napoleon.” ‘This whole cage match idea is completely ridiculous.’ Musk’s obsession with masculine bravado spills into his business rivalries, too. In July, he proposed a cage fight with Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg over the launch of Threads, Meta’s social platform competing with Musk’s Twitter. Last week, Musk suggested the fight will be live-streamed from the Colosseum in Rome. Yesterday (August 13), Musk privately asked Zuckerberg for a practice fight at Zuckerberg’s home in Palo Alto, Calif. Zuckerberg, who has been training intensely for mixed martial arts (MMA) this year, declined. “If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me,” Zuckerberg posted on Threads. “I’m going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously.” Isaacson doesn’t “make predictions” when it comes to Musk, but thinks the fight “seems unlikely,” he told Axios’s Allen. “This whole cage match idea is completely ridiculous.”",

      "text": "14 August 2023 Mark Zuckerberg is slamming Elon Musk for not being “serious” about their cage fight clash. Mark Zuckerberg is slamming Elon Musk for not being ‘serious’ about their cage fight clash The martial artist Facebook founder, 39, hit out as hype continued to grow he and Elon, 52, could face off in Rome’s Colosseum after the Tesla boss challenged Mark in June to an Octagon battle. Mark posted on his Threads platform, created to rival the Elon-owned Twitter, which he has renamed X: “I think we can all agree Elon isn’t serious and it’s time to move on. “Elon won’t confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead. “If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me. “Otherwise, time to move on. I’m going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously.” Hours before the rant, Mark also posted on Threads: “I love this sport [UFC] and I’ve been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me. “If he ever agrees on an actual date, you’ll hear it from me. Until then, please assume anything he says has not been agreed on.” Elon had tweeted on Friday (11.08.23) morning his clash with Mark would be hosted in Rome’s Colosseum. Las Vegas was originally pitched as the potential location for the fight of the tech billionaires. TMZ has reported Mark was approached by the Italian Minister of Culture over staging his showdown with Elon at Rome’s ancient gladiatorial arena. In July, Mark earned a blue belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu after accepting Elon’s cage fight challenge. He took to his Instagram to announce his progress in the martial art and captioned a photo that showed him wearing his new belt alongside his 46-year-old coach Dave Camarillo: “Congrats @davecamarillo on your 5th degree black belt. Honoured to be promoted to compete at blue belt for Guerrilla San Jose team. “You’re a great coach and I’ve learned so much about fighting and life from training with you.” Dave also thanked Mark, saying he was “absolutely honoured” to have been supported by the tech titan. The fight expert added: “Thank you for your support and your amazing display of discipline!” Elon had tweeted on 20 June bragging he was “up for a cage match if (Mark) is”, prompting his Facebook CEO rival to reply on Instagram by telling Elon to “send me the location”.",

      "text": "Billionaires and social-media business rivals Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk threw new online jabs at each other Sunday, with the Meta founder declaring the owner of X – formerly known as Twitter – was not treating a proposed charity cage match seriously. “I think we can all agree Elon isn’t serious and it’s time to move on,” Zuckerberg wrote on his Threads social platform. “I offered a real date … Elon won’t confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead.” Musk quickly responded on X, the platform he bought last year that was previously called Twitter. “Zuck is a chicken,” Musk posted. Musk asks PM Meloni to find ‘epic’ Italian site for Zuckerberg fight The Tesla boss said he would head to Silicon Valley on Monday: “Can’t wait to bang on his door tomorrow.” When an X user suggested Zuckerberg was getting cold feet about the match, Musk referred to a popular US fast food chain known for its chicken offerings. “He can’t eat at Chick-fil-A because that would be cannibalism,” Musk posted. The two tech titans have gone back and forth on social media about fighting each other in a much-hyped charity match. Musk said on Friday the fight would take place in Italy , as authorities there confirmed talks about hosting a “great charity event”. “I spoke to the PM of Italy and Minister of Culture,” Musk wrote, referring to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. “They have agreed on an epic location.” In response, Zuckerberg posted a photo of himself shirtless and pinning down an opponent in his “backyard octagon”. A martial arts enthusiast who has taken part in jiu-jitsu competitions, Zuckerberg said, “I love this sport and I’ve been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me.” “If he ever agrees on an actual date, you’ll hear it from me. Until then, please assume anything he says has not been agreed on.” Italian Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano confirmed speaking to Musk about “how to organise a great charity event evoking history” but said any match “will not be held in Rome.” Sangiuliano said any event with Musk would raise “a huge sum, many millions of euros, [that] will be donated to two important Italian paediatric hospitals.” The two tech tycoons, who have occasionally jousted from afar, became direct competitors after Zuckerberg’s Meta launched its Twitter-like Threads platform in early July . Elon Musk says his cage fight with Mark Zuckerberg will be streamed on X Musk noted on Friday that he may need to undergo “minor surgery” to resolve a “problem with my right shoulder blade rubbing against my ribs.” “Recovery will only take a few months,” he added. The world’s richest person has a titanium plate holding two vertebrae together but said on Friday it is currently “not an issue”.",

      "title": "Elon Musk reveals new 'X' logo to replace Twitter's blue bird",
      "text": "Goodbye, Twitter. Hello, X. Elon Musk has unveiled a new \"X\" logo to replace Twitter's famous blue bird as he follows through with a major rebranding of the social media platform he bought for $44 billion last year. The X started appearing at the top of the desktop version of Twitter on Monday, but the bird was still dominant across the smartphone app. At Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco, meanwhile, workers were seen removing the iconic bird and logo Monday until police showed up and stopped them because they didn't have the proper permits and didn't tape off the sidewalk to keep pedestrians safe if anything fell. As of early afternoon, the \"er\" at the end of Twitter remained visible. The haphazard erasure of both the physical and virtual remnants of Twitter's past were in many ways typical of the chaotic way Musk has run the company since his reluctant purchase. \"It's the end of an era, and a clear signal that the Twitter of the past 17 years is gone and not coming back,\" said Jasmine Enberg, an analyst with Insider Intelligence. \"But the writing was on the wall: Musk has been vocal about transforming Twitter into platform X from the start, and Twitter was already a shell of its former self.\" It's yet another change that Musk has made since acquiring Twitter that has alienated users and turned off advertisers, leaving the microblogging site vulnerable to new threats, including rival Meta's new text-based app Threads that directly targets Twitter users. Musk had asked fans for logo ideas and chose one, which he described as minimalist Art Deco, saying it \"certainly will be refined.\" He replaced his own Twitter icon with a white X on a black background and posted a picture of the design projected on Twitter's San Francisco headquarters. \"And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,\" Musk tweeted Sunday. The X.com web domain now redirects users to Twitter.com, Musk said. \"I can't say I'm surprised, but I think it's a very selfish decision,\" said Hannah Thoreson of Baltimore, Maryland, who's used Twitter since 2009 for work and personal posts. \"There are so many small businesses and so many nonprofits and so many government agencies and things like that all around the world that have relied on Twitter for many years to push their message and reach people,\" she said. \"And they all have the Twitter icon on everything from their website to their business cards.\" Changing all this costs time and money, she added, not to mention the confusion that comes with a previously unknown brand name. \"I mean, do you want to get rid of the Coca-Cola brand if you're Coca-Cola? Why would you do that?\" said Thoreson, who now primarily uses Mastodon. Musk, CEO of Tesla, has long been fascinated with the letter X and had already renamed Twitter's corporate name to X Corp. after he bought it in October. In response to questions about what tweets would be called when the rebranding is done, Musk said they would be called Xs. The billionaire is also CEO of rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp., commonly known as SpaceX. And he started an artificial intelligence company this month called xAI to compete with ChatGPT. In 1999, he founded a startup called X.com, an online financial services company now known as PayPal. Additionally, he calls one of his sons, whose mother is singer Grimes, \"X.\" The child's actual name is a collection of letters and symbols. Musk's Twitter purchase and rebranding are part of his strategy to create what he's dubbed an \" everything app \" similar to China's WeChat, which combines video chats, messaging, streaming and payments. Musk has made a number of drastic changes since taking over Twitter, including a shift to focusing on paid subscriptions, but he doesn't always follow through on his attention-grabbing new policy pronouncements. Linda Yaccarino, the longtime NBC Universal executive Musk tapped to be Twitter CEO in May, posted the new logo and weighed in on the change, writing on Twitter that X would be \"the future state of unlimited interactivity — centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking — creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.\" But ad industry analysts were less certain about X's prospects. \"Musk supporters will likely celebrate the rebrand, but it's a gloomy day for many Twitter users and advertisers,\" Enberg said. \"Twitter's corporate brand is already heavily intertwined with Musk's personal brand, with or without the name X, and much of Twitter's established brand equity has already been lost among users and advertisers.\" Some predicted the new name will confuse much of Twitter's audience, which has already been souring on the social media platform following Musk's other modifications, including limiting the number of tweets users can read each day. The new threshold is part of an $8-per-month subscription service Musk rolled out earlier this year in an attempt to boost Twitter revenue. Whether advertisers will ever return depends on how successful the rebranding is and whether Musk is able to accomplish his goal of creating an \"everything app.\" That remains to be seen, said ad expert Mark DiMassimo. \"Advertisers care about what they're buying. So if his strategies work, I don't think advertisers could care less about what he calls it,\" DiMassimo said. \"I think changing the name is just a way for him to say, 'Stop having Twitter expectations, this is a new thing, judge it as a new thing,'\" he added. \"And you know, that only works if the new thing works.\" Twitter users also pointed out that few people refer to Alphabet, Google's parent company since 2015. Facebook renamed itself Meta in 2021, but its collection of apps — Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook — still retain their own brands and logos. Twitter's recognizable blue bird logo went live more than a decade ago in 2012, replacing an earlier bird logo ahead of the company's Wall Street debut as a publicly traded company. \"I'm sad to see it go. It had a great run,\" said the logo's designer, Martin Grasser. \"But 11 years, 12 years is really long for a corporate identity to stick around. It feels like the platform is changing and they have a new direction and it makes sense\" that they would pick a new logo to signal those changes.",

      "text": "Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has accused Elon Musk of wasting his time and never being ‘serious’ about competing in a much-hyped cage fight. The maverick Tesla boss, 52, has repeatedly mocked and discussed fighting Zuckerberg, 39, on his social media site, which was recently renamed from Twitter to X. He also claimed that it could take place soon in a high-profile venue in Italy. However, posting on his rival social media site Threads, Zuckerberg poured cold water on the claims, writing: ‘I think we can all agree Elon isn’t serious and it’s time to move on.’ The Meta boss went on to accuse his fellow mogul of stalling for time after Musk apparently texted to ask for a ‘practise’ round and indicated he had a minor shoulder ailment.

I’m going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously.’ Zuckerberg had again signalled his frustration hours earlier, writing: ‘I love this sport [UFC] and I’ve been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me. 'If he ever agrees on an actual date, you’ll hear it from me. Until then, please assume anything he says has not been agreed on.’ On Friday morning Musk tweeted that his showdown with Zuckerberg will occur at Rome's Colosseum and it will be managed by their foundations.

      "title": "Beginning of the end: how Elon Musk’s removal of the block function on X could trigger its hellish demise",
      "text": "On Saturday, X (formerly Twitter) chairman Elon Musk tweeted he would be removing the microblogging platform’s block function. It would remain intact for direct messages, but would otherwise become obsolete. This is the latest in a series of controversial and often confusing moves from Musk since he took ownership of the platform in October 2022. Why does Musk want to block the block function? And what might the consequences be for users, and indeed the future of the platform? Why block the ‘block’? Simply, the block function on X prevents one user from interacting with another. With the click of a button, the blocker can deny another user the ability to read their tweets or reshare their content. Musk’s dislike of this feature isn’t new. In June he remarked that “blocking public posts makes no sense”. He has also condemned campaigns among users to block subscribers paying for a Twitter Blue subscription (which grants them perks such as a blue tick beside their name and the ability to edit posts). Musk’s latest pronouncement might be related to his self-styled “free speech absolutist” persona. Last year, after he announced the deal to purchase X (then Twitter), Musk remarked: Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated. Accordingly, Musk then restored accounts that had been banned for what previous site moderators classified as dangerous content. These high-profile reinstatements included rapper Kanye West (removed for anti-Semitism), congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (removed for spreading COVID misinformation) and right-wing personality Dominick McGee (who posted child abuse material). In June of this year, Musk publicly said “distasteful” content – including tweets celebrating a migrant boat accident in the Mediterranean Sea in which lives were lost – could remain online as long as they weren’t illegal. Of course, “blocking” someone on social media isn’t the same as removing their account or deleting content. Blocking is not censorship as this is commonly understood in a social media context; it does not involve, say, removing users or their content from a platform, or even shadow-banning (whereby a platform reduces the visibility of certain posts among a large number of users). That said, blocking does threaten the pugilistic model of free speech Musk endorses. He has called X the “player versus player” (a kind of duelling mode in online video games) of social media. The likelihood of skirmishes is reduced when “players” can block one another. What would the consequences be? Perhaps blocking the “block” function would allow lively and heated (but not harmful) debate to flourish on X. Or perhaps not. As Adi Robertson writes in an article for The Verge: Blocking provides some very tangible benefits, helping users (especially high-profile ones) do anything from avoiding harassment to simply cleaning up spam in their replies. It can also prevent exposure to hate speech, which has risen since Musk took ownership. According to the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, X “fails to act on 99% of hate posted by Twitter Blue subscribers”. Musk has disputed the findings and filed a lawsuit against the group (an action that sits uneasily alongside his free-speech absolutism). The inability to block hate speech could help normalise it and create a hostile environment for people in groups that are often targeted, such as women, LGBTQ+ people, Indigenous people and migrants. X has long been labelled a “hellsite” on account of the toxicity that appears on the platform. In a post-block era, it might become even more hellish. What happens beyond the block? Musk has suggested “a stronger form of mute” could replace the block function. The mute function currently allows users to avoid seeing the activities of certain other users – but the muted person can still interact with the muter (such as by commenting on their posts) in a way that a blocked person can’t. What would “a stronger form of mute” look like? Musk hasn’t said. His plans to remove the block and implement this function seem particularly unclear when you consider he has already fired so many of the company’s workers, including technical staff. Further, both the Apple Store and Google Play have guidelines stipulating that platforms hosting user-generated content must allow the blocking of other users. Removing this capacity might lead to the app stores dropping X, which could spell economic death for the platform. Worded differently, Musk might succeed in “blocking” X from its users permanently. Or he may argue a stronger form of mute fulfils the same requirements as the block function. Either way, the signs point to a strong likelihood of X becoming a particularly nightmarish town square.

      "text": "Ever since Elon Musk acquired Twitter back in October 2022, the microblogging platform has witnessed a tremendous amount of changes, and most of these modifications have sparked controversy among its users. Elon is now hinting that Twitter might soon cryptically undergo a major branding overhaul. According to Elon's latest tweet, which says, \"And soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,\" Twitter might soon move away from the brand name \"Twitter,\" and it could even get a new logo instead of the bluebird. This means that, while Twitter remains the same, it might soon go by a different name and identity. And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2023 Before Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion, the social media platform was a publicly listed company under the name Twitter, Inc. Currently, it's a private company listed under X Corp, where Elon Musk is the CTO and chairman. The new branding of Twitter is likely to be in line with the new parent company's vision. Elon also referenced the branding \"X\" while introducing the new CEO Linda Yaccarino, which could be the new name of Twitter. I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!@LindaYacc will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology. Looking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X, the everything app. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2023 In another incident, Elon Musk briefly replaced the Twitter logo with the Dogecoin logo, which was again replaced by the iconic blue bird. Besides advertising, Twitter is currently looking at strengthening parallel revenue sources, which includes the introduction of a Twitter Blue subscription. By limiting various features to paid users, Twitter is encouraging more users to onboard the subscription bandwagon to enjoy all the features of Twitter. One such move is the 20 direct message (DM) limit for non-blue users.",

      "text": "Elon Musk's proposal to change the Twitter logo from a bird to an \"X\" was met with ridicule and jokes from the platform's users on Sunday.Musk, whose purchase of the social media giant last year has been marred by financial troubles, outages and other controversies, suggested he would soon rebrand the platform in a series of tweets posted on Sunday, just after midnight ET. These changes could include a shift away from the traditional bird iconography the platform has used since its launch, he wrote.\"And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,\" Musk tweeted.He also wrote that the logo could be changed as soon as Sunday, and would \"of course\" be in an Art Deco style in follow-up tweets. Musk also floated some other changes to the platform, such as making its default color black. Twitter also announced this week that it would implement limits on how many direct messages unverified users can send.Newsweek reached out to Musk via his Tesla and SpaceX companies for comment via email, as Musk disbanded Twitter's public relations team last year.Musk's proposal sparked an avalanche of critiques and jokes early Sunday morning.Commentator Ed Krassenstein wrote in a lengthy post critiquing the potential change that Musk's rebrand would \"single-handedly kill Twitter.\"\"Anyone who tries to defend Elon Musk over this move is either brainwashed or completely insane,\" he tweeted. \"We've seen Elon fail at this type of branding once with one of his children. Who names a kid X Æ A-12 Musk? Now he's going to do it to Twitter!\"Twitter user Ed Hall tweeted a mocking proposal for the new logo, sharing an image of the current logo dead with an \"X\" over its eye captioned, \"Introducing Twitter X.\"Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, tweeted that a rebrand would not change the issues many critics have taken with over his leadership, specifically pointing to his \"free speech\" pledge that critics say emboldened conspiracy theorists and hate speech.\"I remember when the Cleveland Browns made a big deal about changing uniform colors. They were still mediocre. Twitter is a worse product now not because of the bird logo, but because @elonmusk elevates conspiracy folks like the pizza gate guy. Twitter X doesn't change that fact,\" the congressman wrote.Journalist Bridget Carey tweeted, \"A week ago I went on national television and said Twitter is becoming garbage. Now he's actually throwing it all away.\"Twitter user Joe Katz tweeted, \"Renaming Twitter X is the 21st century replacement for 'rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic' we didn't know we needed.\"Several of Musk's changes to Twitter have been met with mixed reaction from the community.Musk introduced \"Twitter Blue,\" a subscription service for the platform that allows users to become verified. The service replaces the old verification system allowing prominent accounts to receive a \"blue checkmark\" for free. Experts have warned this change will make it easier for misinformation to spread.Earlier this month, Musk temporarily placed limits on how many tweets unverified users could view per day, but this feature appears to have been since removed.Others have also criticized his efforts to prioritize \"free speech\" on the platform, arguing that he has emboldened those who spread hate speech. The Jewish Democratic Council of America warned in April that Twitter's antisemitism \"skyrocketed\" after his purchase.",

      "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Says &#039;Time To Move On&#039; From Elon Musk Fight - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t think his fight with Elon Musk will ever happen. “I think we can all agree Elon isn’t serious and it’s time to move on,” Zuckerberg, 39, wrote via Threads on Sunday, August 13. “I offered a real date. [UFC President] Dana White offered to make this a legit competition for charity.” The Facebook founder went on to blame Musk, who owns X (formerly known as Twitter), for scheduling issues. “Elon won’t confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead,” Zuckerberg noted. “If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me. Otherwise, time to move on. I’m going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously.” The Meta owner seems to be bringing weeks of fight talk to an end. Musk, 52, first challenged Zuckerberg in June. After Musk commented on a post claiming that Zuckerberg was looking to create a new platform to compete with Twitter (Meta launched Threads weeks later), a fellow user warned Musk to be “careful” around Zuckerberg, who has taken up jiu-jitsu as a hobby. The South Africa native tweeted in response: “I’m up for a cage match if he is lol.” Zuckerberg shared a screenshot of Musk’s tweet via his Instagram Story on June 21, writing, “Send me location.” Since then, it’s been a back-and-forth about details, including date and location. Initially, Musk wanted to do the fight at the “Vegas Octagon” and more recently he suggested Rome. “The fight will be managed by my and Zuck’s foundations (not UFC),” he wrote via X on Friday, August 11. “Livestream will be on this platform and Meta. Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome, so nothing modern at all. I spoke to the PM of Italy and Minister of Culture. They have agreed on an epic location. Everything done will pay respect to the past and present of Italy and all proceeds go to veterans and pediatric hospitals in Italy.” However, Musk also revealed that he needed surgery soon. “There is a problem with my right shoulder blade rubbing against my ribs, which requires minor surgery. Recovery will only take a few months,” he told a follower. On the same day, Zuckerberg clarified that nothing about their possible match was set in stone. “I love this sport and I’ve been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me,” the New York native said via Threads. “If he ever agrees on an actual date, you’ll hear it from me. Until then, please assume anything he says has not been agreed on.” Zuckerberg, who competed in his first jiu jitsu tournament earlier this year, noted that he doesn’t expect Musk to be his next opponent in the ring. “Not holding my breath for Elon, but I’ll share details on my next fight when I’m ready,” he added on Friday. “When I compete, I want to do it in a way that puts a spotlight on the elite athletes at the top of the game. You do that by working with professional orgs like the UFC or ONE to pull this off well and create a great card.”",

      "title": "Karlin Lillington:  X? Really? Really, Elon Musk? X?",
      "text": "X is the spiffy new name (if you are, say, 13 years old) that tiresome billionaire Elon Musk has come up with as a replacement for that blasted place formerly known as Twitter. You remember Twitter, the “public square” that, post Musk purchase, is withering into a global marketplace for cryptocurrency mavens attempting to offload the virtual coinage to each other. Give that man a poop emoji. To be fair, the site still boasts a decent rump of people, the kind of active users that once made TwitterX an interesting place to be. For me, that was a mix of political and social commentators, scientists and researchers, tech and privacy experts, and creative folks of all sorts. But they’re now soldered on to an ungainly torso comprising the types of people who rushed to buy Musk’s going-cheap blue tick accounts to validate, I don’t know, something. Their egos, their search engine optimisation or crypto hype, or their right-wing views. On the “going concern” side, TwitterX continues to be the strangest show in the social media town. Musk once loved the platform, or if not the platform, at least the ability to incessantly use it to express odd business and personal views and — in what is admittedly a crowded field — the most boring sense of humour in techdom. But he is slow clapping TwitterX into meaninglessness, if not oblivion. I can’t remember anything like it in 25 years of writing about the technology industry. So many more productive ways exist to rid yourself of $44 billion (€40 billion), the amount Musk paid for Twitter. I’m sure you could think of a few. But to blow it all to buy struggling, overpriced Twitter, and then grind your heel into what value still remains in the beleaguered bird site, is quite a demonstration of a very personal brand of business ... one hesitates to call it acumen. Rebranding to something that sounds like the forlorn offspring of a porn hub and a discussion site for gaming platform enthusiasts immediately knocked off an estimated $4 to $20 million of brand value, depending on various brand experts Bloomberg spoke to during the week. [ Elon Musk finds his inner Ken and paints Twitter black for ‘X’ vision ] It’s incomprehensible that he’d throw away the bird and the term “tweet”, a word that, like “google”, has become a lower-case noun and verb in common global use and a route for significant public statements by politicians, celebrities, activists, and national and global organisations. The site now looks increasingly like a better-capitalised version of Trump’s rival network, Truth Social. The heart (and the mind) sink upon reading Musk — ‘X’ed? Tweeted? What the heck are we supposed to say? — that the site “was acquired by X Corp both to ensure freedom of speech and as an accelerant for X, the everything app”. Oh no. And oh yes, the “X Corporation”. Perhaps, like most of the world, you failed to notice or care that Musk had changed Twitter’s parent company name to the X Corporation months ago. It’s all so retro-50′s pulp fiction, except that it doesn’t carry the creative lightheartedness of that era and just sounds dad-joke dumb. Perhaps more insight is offered by the fact that, once Musk’s Ministry of Silly Names coughed out the X rebrand, Musk also revealed: “In the months to come, we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world.” This, from the ardent promoter of the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. Twitter has already been used for Musk’s own cryptomarketing. Back in April, as crypto values were tanking due to company failures and indictments of some people involved with various crypto companies, Musk projected Dogecoin’s Shiba Inu dog logo on the side of Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters, prompting the coin’s market value to rise by $4 billion. Yep. Really, those rump members left on Musk’s comic book X-world should probably start thinking about alternatives. Whatever TwitterX ends up being — if it survives at all — it won’t be a “public square” of influential or quotable public discourse any more than bored ape NFTs represent the future of global investment. [ Twitter changes logo to X in corporate rebranding ] The thing is, as long as all these moves are legal, Musk has every right to do this and whatever else he wants with his $44 billion purchase. That, as Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin wrote this week, is what capitalism is all about. You can drive your purchase into a wall, which in TwitterX’s case, might now be a good thing. But TwitterX’s slow-crumble into two vast and trunkless legs of stone in a discourse desert obscures the fact that profit-seeking corporate social media platforms based on monetising user data and driven by targeted advertising were never a true public square any more than EuroDisney is. Sure, flee to Threads, Instagram, Snapchat or any other commercial, for-profit platform, but it’s all the same. You’re in corporate-controlled marketplaces, not true public squares. You and your data — your “free” speech and your activities — are the product; you are also the advertising target. The public square bit is just a potentially ephemeral marketplace byproduct, not the intent.",

      "title": "‘The everything app’: why Elon Musk wants X to be a WeChat for the west",
      "text": "Daily life in Chinese cities is nearly impossible to navigate without WeChat, to the extent that being barred from the country’s super-app has been likened to a “digital death”. Commonly described as a smartphone messaging platform, it is more like several apps rolled into one, used for messaging, social media, payments, subscriptions, utility bills, food deliveries, plane and train tickets, ride hailing and much more. It is owned by the Chinese tech giant Tencent. And Elon Musk would like a rebranded Twitter to be just as indispensable in the west. Last weekend, he announced that the social media platform, which he bought for $44bn last year, would be renamed “X”. The world’s richest person has a long history with the X brand, having called his online banking business x.com before it became PayPal in 2000. Now he wants X to become like WeChat. Shortly before buying Twitter, Musk wrote: “Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” In a tweet on Tuesday, Musk wrote that Twitter had already changed significantly from its early days by offering video as well – now more change is on its way. “In the months to come, we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world. The Twitter name does not make sense in that context, so we must bid adieu to the bird,” he wrote. In June last year, Musk told Twitter staff that the company could emulate WeChat. “You basically live on WeChat in China because it’s so usable and helpful to daily life, and I think if we can achieve that, or even get close to that at Twitter, it would be an immense success.” Some of the mini apps within WeChat are operated by Tencent directly, while others are from smaller businesses that have partnered with Tencent to get direct access to WeChat’s 1.2 billion monthly users. There is no parallel in the west. “Imagine if you used OpenTable, Uber and Deliveroo entirely inside the Facebook app, using your Facebook identity and a Facebook payment account instead of a credit card – and then you paid for coffee and paid for the tube with it as well,” says Benedict Evans, a tech analyst. WeChat’s payment function allows users to pay for goods from within the WeChat app. Users simply have to scan a merchant’s QR code to pay for a good using “cash” in their WeChat wallet, which is connected to a bank account. Users can also easily send money to each other via WeChat messages. Linda Yaccarino, Twitter’s chief executive, has said payments and banking will be a focus for the rebranded business. Fascination with the everything app idea is not new and has been on western tech execs’ minds for years. It was reported last year that Microsoft has considered building a “super app”. Bruce Daisley, the former head of Twitter’s European operations, says he went on holiday to China in 2018 and was captivated by WeChat. “It’s impossible not to be intoxicated by WeChat and the hold it has got on Chinese life, from messaging people to ordering cabs and paying for things,” he says. Daisley says it is a “slightly flawed premise” to presume that because everything apps have emerged and succeeded in China the same will happen elsewhere. He adds, however, that making payments a key part of a rebranded Twitter platform – a clear ambition of Musk’s – could work in the US, where the online banking and payments set-up is less well developed than in the UK and Europe. The question is whether you would trust Musk with any payments process, Daisley says. “When it comes to banking, most of us want slightly boring apps where we put our money,” he says. Daisley also argues that Twitter has become a more toxic brand under Musk, which lessens its appeal as a financial service provider. “The idea that I would use an app that I find more jarring under Elon Musk’s ownership, that I would trust it enough to put my money into it, is fanciful.” Lucy Ingham, the head of content at FXC Intelligence, a data company, says there is a logic to Musk’s ambitions for the platform. Large numbers of people already link to payment options on their account profiles, she says. “There are lots and lots of people who ask for money through Twitter … a version of Twitter could make a commercial play with that,” she says, before adding: “You can have a really good product and a really good system, but if people don’t trust it, it’s not going to happen.” Analysts also point to structural barriers for an everything app in the western world. Tencent was able to build WeChat in China more than a decade ago when the market there was still in flux, whereas in the west there are well-established players in individual sectors of the digital economy, such as Google in search, Facebook in social media and Amazon in e-commerce. Evans doubts whether a western app would want to hand over control of its customer experience to a Musk-operated everything app. “Why would you hand over your destiny to a third-party platform? In China you have to because everyone is on WeChat. Twitter has a very small user base,” he says, adding that Musk has shown himself to be a “very unreliable partner” since he bought Twitter. Melissa Ingle, a former senior data scientist at Twitter, says Musk’s ambitions could be difficult to carry out after the Tesla CEO axed 80% of the platform’s workforce. “Setting up an entire payment structure is so labour-intensive and he has cut [the workforce] to the absolute bone. To set up a payments app seems fanciful at this point.” Musk is adamant, however, that the platform he bought for a vast sum of money faces its own digital death if it does not change. Some of the advertisers that generate the vast majority of its revenue have either halted spending or reduced it sharply, the company has a debt burden of $13bn and Musk has dropped the brand that made Twitter a force in social media. He has to hope that users will accept the looming transformation and give the platform another life.",

      "title": "Elon Musk studied Napoleon's leadership style, author Walter Isaacson says",
      "text": "Elon Musk has studied the life of Napoleon Bonaparte for leadership inspiration, according to biographer Walter Isaacson. The billionaire “likes military history” and “believes there are lessons that apply to corporate life” from studying the career of the pint-size French general and dictator, according to Isaacson, who is set to release a biography entitled “Elon Musk” next month. “He believes that wherever Napoleon was, that’s where his armies would do best. So he liked to show up late at night on the assembly lines at Tesla and SpaceX,” Isaacson said in an interview with Axios published Monday. Musk has built a reputation as a brilliant but erratic leader while running the show at his various companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, the company formerly known as Twitter, brain chip startup Neuralink and infrastructure firm The Boring Company. In his book, Isaacson detailed one instance in which Musk spent an hour overseeing work on one of SpaceX’s Starship boosters that was under construction at the private space firm’s launch site in Texas. “If they see their general on the battlefield, they will be more motivated,” Musk reportedly said about the tactic. “I learned that by reading about Napoleon.” Musk often listens to the popular podcast “Hardcore History” podcast at night, added Isaacson. Musk praised Napoleon on social media last year, responding to a meme by stating that the general’s “success was in fact due, in part, because he was super fun at parties, spoke and wrote incredibly well!” Scrutiny over Musk’s leadership style has intensified since his $44 billion takeover of Twitter last year. Since buying the firm, Musk has purged its ranks with mass layoffs, demanded remaining employees adopt an “extremely hardcore” work ethic and ditched Twitter’s iconic blue bird logo in favor of a rebrand to the letter “X.” Musk is also a vocal critic of remote work — once describing the concept of working from home as “morally wrong.” He has enacted strict office attendance policies at Tesla and Twitter. Last month, Esther Crawford, a former Twitter executive who became famous for sleeping on the office floor while scrambling to meet one of Musk’s deadlines, said the billionaire is a dynamic leader but has a “painful” lack of empathy for those around him. Isaacson, 71, is one of the most prominent biographers, having previously written tomes about the lives of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Apple founder Steve Jobs, among others. Earlier this week, Isaacson made waves after sharing a screenshot he received from Musk just before 5 a.m. local time on Sunday. In the texts, Zuckerberg told Musk that the pair should “move on” from their much-hyped “cage match” unless they can set a date for the bout. Isaacson told Axios that an actual fight between Musk and Zuckerberg “seems unlikely.” “I obviously think that this whole cage match idea is completely ridiculous,” he added.",

      "title": "Elon Musk Says Twitter Will Soon Change Its Logo To ‘X’ - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "Elon Musk said Sunday (July 23) that he plans to change the logo of Twitter to an “X” from the famous blue bird, marking what would be the latest big change since he bought the social media platform for $44 billion last year. In a series of posts on his Twitter account starting just after 12 a.m. ET, Twitter’s owner said that he’s looking to make the change worldwide as soon as Monday. “And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,” Musk wrote on his account. The change isn’t surprising given Musk’s long history with the name “X,” says Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce. The billionaire Tesla CEO tweeted last October that “buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Musk’s rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., is commonly known as SpaceX. And in 1999, Musk founded a startup called X.com, an online financial services company now known as PayPal. “Not sure what subtle clues gave it way, but I like the letter X,” Musk tweeted Sunday. But the change on Twitter was met with sharp criticism on the social media platform. The change will be very confusing to a huge chunk of the Twitter’s audience, which has been already souring on the social platform given a slew of other major changes Musk has made, Adamson said. “They won’t get it,” he said. “It’s a fitting end to a phenomenal unwinding of an iconic brand and business.” Earlier this month, Musk put new curfews on his digital town square, a move that met with sharp criticism that it could drive away more advertisers and undermine its cultural influence as a trendsetter. The higher tweet-viewing threshold is part of an $8-per-month subscription service that Musk rolled out earlier this year in an attempt to boost Twitter revenue. Revenue has dropped sharply since Musk took over the company and laid off roughly three-fourths of the workforce to slash costs and avoid bankruptcy. In May, Musk hired longtime NBC Universal executive Linda Yaccarino as Twitter’s CEO. Luring advertisers is essential for Musk and Twitter after many fled in the early months after his takeover of the social media platform, fearing damage to their brands in the enveloping chaos. Advertisers have cut back on spending partly because of changes Musk has made that has allowed for more hateful content to flourish and that has offended a wider part of the platform’s audience. Musk said in late April that advertisers had returned, but provided no specifics. Musk’s move to change Twitter’s logo to an “X” also comes as Twitter faces new competition from Meta’s new app, Threads, launched earlier this month. It has been seen as an alternative for those who have been upset with Twitter. Threads is being billed as a text-based version of Meta’s photo-sharing app Instagram that the company has said offers “a new, separate space for real-time updates and public conversations.” In the first five days of its launch, 100 million people had signed up for Threads, according to a post on Threads by Instagram head Adam Mosseri.",

      "title": "Mark Zuckerberg says Elon Musk &#8216;isn&#8217;t serious&#8217; about cage fight",
      "text": "It doesn’t seem like we’ll get to see Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk face off in the ring any time soon. In June, the two tech bosses proposed a “cage match” against one another. Tension and competition between Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter) and Zuckerberg’s new app Threads created even more online hype for the two billionaires to battle it out. But on Sunday, the Meta CEO appeared to have lost faith in Musk’s proposal for the mixed martial arts (MMA) fight. “I think we can all agree Elon isn’t serious and it’s time to move on,” Zuckerberg, 39, wrote on Threads. Zuckerberg claimed he offered Musk, 52, a “real date” for the fight. He said Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) president, offered to make the spectacle “a legit competition for charity.” “Elon won’t confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead,” Zuckerberg continued. On Aug. 6, Musk posted to X that he “may require surgery” on his back before he can fight Zuckerberg. “If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me. Otherwise, time to move on. I’m going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously,” concluded Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, a jiu-jitsu enthusiast, already competes against people who take MMA as seriously as he does. Last month, the Facebook founder said he had obtained his blue belt in the sport. It reportedly takes between one and three years of training to earn a blue belt in jiu-jitsu. Musk has not responded to Zuckerberg’s call-out. Last week, however, Musk claimed the fight would take place in Rome, Italy. He said he spoke to Italy’s prime minister and minister of culture, who agreed on an “epic location” for the match. Two days later, Musk shared a text allegedly from Zuckerberg that suggested the Tesla boss train on his own, then let Zuckerberg know when he was ready to fight. “I don’t want to keep hyping something that will never happen, so you should either decide you’re going to do this and do it soon, or we should move on,” the text reads. Musk replied by suggesting he would win against Zuckerberg because of their size difference — but speculated perhaps Zuckerberg is “a modern day Bruce Lee and will somehow win.” It seems though that the only place Musk and Zuckerberg may be fighting is in the courtroom. Last month, Twitter sent a cease-and-desist letter over the launch of Threads, which Musk and his team claim is an “unlawful misappropriation of Twitter’s trade secrets and other intellectual property.”",

      "text": "The ongoing saga between tech giants Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg has taken yet another bizarre twist, leaving MMA fans and enthusiasts bewildered by the escalating drama surrounding their proposed clash. What started as a tongue-in-cheek exchange has evolved into a public spectacle, complete with location disputes, gaslighting, and a seemingly never-ending cycle of challenges and counter-challenges. In the last few days, the Clash of the Titans has reached new heights of absurdity. Elon Musk the CEO of Tesla has taken to his platform to provide elaborate details about the much-talked-about fight. Even suggesting that the historical Colosseum in Italy would serve as the battleground. He also took the opportunity to distance the proposed fight from the UFC asserting that the promotion would not be involved. However, Mark Zuckerberg the co-founder of Facebook swiftly dismissed Musk’s claims urging fans to take everything with a grain of salt and advising them to ignore Musk’s statements. Zuckerberg went on to express his frustration with the situation implying that Musk had not been cooperative in agreeing to realistic terms for the proposed fight. Elon Musk vs Mark Zuckerberg: The never-ending drama of a fantasy fight Just as MMA enthusiasts were prepared to heed Zuckerberg’s advice and move on from the spectacle. Musk reignited the flame by refusing to back down. He escalated matters by threatening to show up at Zuckerberg’s residence in Palo Alto for the showdown adding a layer of absurdity to an already outlandish situation. In his attempt to further provoke the Facebook CEO, Musk took to his platform once again detailing the back-and-forth exchanges that had taken place. He sarcastically recounted how he had suggested various locations for the fight only for Zuckerberg to decline each one citing different reasons. Musk even humorously suggested Zuckerberg’s own home as a “safe space” for the fight to which the latter allegedly responded by claiming he was “traveling.” What began as a lighthearted exchange has quickly spiraled into a spectacle of epic proportions with both Musk and Zuckerberg seemingly attempting to one-up each other. The circus-like atmosphere surrounding the proposed fight has drawn skepticism and amusement from fans and observers alike. It’s no longer just about the possibility of a fight. It’s become a test of wit and bravado between two tech billionaires. The sentiment among those following the saga appears to be divided. Some may still hold out hope for the unlikely clash to materialize driven by the allure of seeing two influential figures from the tech world settle their differences in the Octagon. Others, however, are inclined to agree with Zuckerberg’s suggestion to “move on” from the spectacle viewing it as a distraction from more pressing matters.

According to the post, Mr Zuckerberg wrote: \"If you still want to do a real MMA [mixed martial arts] fight, then you should train on your own and let me know when you're ready to compete. \"I don't want to keep hyping something that will never happen, so you should either decide you're going to do this and do it soon, or we should move on.\" Read more:X (formerly Twitter) sues group accusing Elon Musk of allowing hate speech to thriveGiant flashing X sign removed from Twitter's San Francisco HQ after complaintsElon Musk reveals why he's rebranding Twitter to X Mr Musk replied: \"I will be in Palo Alto on Monday.

But Zuckerberg responded by saying he was \"not holding his breath\". He added: \"I love this sport and I've been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me. \"If he ever agrees on an actual date, you'll hear it from me. Until then, please assume anything he says has not been agreed on.\"",

The CEO also stated that they are working on something better than the current block and mute features. Ms Yaccarino's statement came in response to a post by anti-bullying activist Monica Lewinsky, who urged the Twitter CEO and Elon Musk to rethink their decision of removing the block feature. “Please rethink removing the block feature.

You will still be able to mute accounts and block users for DMs— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 18, 2023 According to Twitter, the block feature “helps you control how you interact with other accounts on Twitter. This feature helps people in restricting specific accounts from contacting them, seeing their Tweets, and following them”. The feature is used by many on the microblogging platform to avoid harassment, bullying, and stalking. Blocked accounts don't get notified when someone blocks them. However, they can know if a person has blocked them by visiting their profile. On the other hand, the mute is a feature that “allows you to remove an account's Tweets from your timeline without unfollowing or blocking that account”. Users cannot know if someone has muted them.",

      "title": "Is Tesla A Buy Or A Sell With This Analyst Saying TSLA Is A &#039;Table Pounder&#039;? - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "Tesla (TSLA) stock has been pulling back since second-quarter financials on July 19, as investor concerns over falling gross margins seems to be outweighing the global EV giant’s earnings and revenue-beating numbers. X While shares have dropped around 16% in August, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, told CNBC on August 16 he remains “firmly bullish.” “I view this more as a selloff post-quarter, worries about China,” Ives said. The analyst added he views this “as an opportunity” and that Tesla is a “table pounder at these levels.” The drop in Tesla stock comes after the EV giant reported Q2 profits growing 20% to 91 cents per share while revenue increased 47% to $24.93 billion. Analysts expected profits to edge up around 4% to 80 cents per share with revenue totaling $24.22 billion, up 43% compared with last year. Tesla’s total gross profit grew 7% to $4.53 billion in the second quarter. Meanwhile, total gross margins came in at 18.2%, down from 19.3% in Q1 and a decline of 682 basis points vs. last year. Auto gross margins, excluding regulatory credits and leases, came in at 18.1%, down from 18.3% in Q1. That is below the 20% gross margin “floor” Tesla previously targeted. Ahead of earnings, a slew of analysts rang warning bells on gross margins. “The short-term variances in gross margins and profitability really are minor relative to the long term picture,” Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors during the Q2 earnings call. “Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly,” he added. Stock Falls After Earnings However on July 20, TSLA tumbled 9.7% to 262.90, falling below the 21-day line but only giving up July gains. Ahead of earnings, Cathie Wood sold tranches of her firm’s Tesla stock holdings in consecutive sessions, unloading more than 73,000 shares before the EV giant reported second-quarter financials. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas on July 24 wrote he expects Tesla’s full-year auto gross margins to remain below 20% until 2025. Wood sold another 20,700 shares of Tesla stock on July 25 for around $5.49 million, based on the closing price of 265.28. Meanwhile, Tesla announced on August 7 that Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn is stepping down. The EV giant announced in federal filings that Vaibhav Taneja took over from Kirkhorn on Aug. 4. Taneja will now serve as CFO as well as his current role of chief accounting officer. “During his tenure, Tesla has seen tremendous expansion and growth,” the company wrote in the SEC filing. “Tesla thanks Mr. Kirkhorn for his significant contributions.” On August 8, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi told investors Kirkhorn’s exit is “tough to spin positively.” Sacconaghi added that Tesla is “obviously a demanding place, and Elon is tough to work for.” However, the analyst noted “this doesn’t sound like investors need to run for the hills, but clearly Kirkhorn made a personal decision that sticking around wasn’t worth it.” Tesla Stock And Musk There is never a dull moment for Tesla and Musk, with the two inextricably linked. Since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 28, purchasing the social media platform for $44 billion, some longtime Tesla stock bulls have worried Musk’s focus on Twitter, along with negative attention, is weighing down Tesla stock. Musk appeared to lessen those fears when he hired Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal’s advertising chief, as the new CEO for X Corp., formerly known as Twitter. The Tesla chief added Yaccarino will focus on business operations while he will work on product design and new technology. At the time, Ives wrote the news ends some of the “distraction risk around the Tesla story.” With TSLA shares pulling back after earnings, the top question for investors is always, when is it a good time to buy or sell Tesla stock. Tesla and Musk are betting big on the Cybertruck and autonomous vehicle technology, along with a possible tailwind from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Tesla A Monster Stock Over Much Of Its History Almost single-handedly, Musk has turned the auto industry on its head, essentially forcing it to get aboard the electric-vehicle train. It’s a reason why Tesla has been a monster stock over much of its history, especially during its stratospheric run from mid-2019 to late 2021. The stock hit a bear market low of 101.84 on Jan. 6, but roared back until Q1 earnings. On April 19, Tesla reported a big first-quarter earnings decline while revenue missed views. Profit margins for the global EV giant also fell below 20% as the company executed an aggressive price-slashing strategy in the first part of 2023. Tesla reported revenue increasing 24% to $23.33 billion with EPS of 85 cents, a 20% decline compared to 2022. The EV company’s total gross profit came in at $4.5 billion, with Tesla’s profit gross margin at 19.3%, down from 23.8% in Q4 and 29.1% a year earlier. Tesla’s Global Price Cutting Strategy Tesla slashed prices worldwide multiple times in 2023, starting in January and continuing into April. The only exception is China, where Tesla cut prices significantly in late October before reductions in early January. On August 13, Tesla cut prices in China on two Model Y vehicle trims and began offering a limited-time insurance subsidy for Model 3 buyers. The August buyer-incentive for existing Model 3’s comes as rumors are swirling that the updated Tesla Model 3, code-named Highland, is set for an imminent release in China. On August 14, Tesla then launched new, shorter-range versions of its Model S and Model X vehicles, slashing the U.S. price tag on its base luxury electric vehicles by $10,000. On August 16, Tesla fired another shot in the EV price war, nearly doubling discounts on its luxury Model S and Model X vehicles in China. Meanwhile, Tesla’s upgraded Model 3 is expected to go on sale in China within a month, local media China Securities Journal reported on August 16. Tesla has already started accepting reservations for the new Model 3, according to the report. Earlier in the year, Tesla reduced prices in several European markets. Tesla also dropped the price of its electric vehicles in Israel and Singapore in order to increase demand, expanding a worldwide discount push that began in China in January. Tesla Stock: Betting On Autonomous Vehicles And The Cybertruck Musk has long touted Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and the potential value it brings to the brand. The Tesla CEO told investors during the Q1 earnings call the “value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.” Musk also stressed that improvements in the FSD beta are “really quite dramatic.” “The trend is very clearly toward full autonomy, and I hesitate to say this, but I think we’ll do it this year,” Musk said, referring to self-driving vehicles. Meanwhile, Musk has confirmed that a Cybertruck delivery event will take place later in 2023. Tesla reported in its Q2 financials the Cybertruck “remains on track to begin initial production later this year at Gigafactory Texas.” However, the EV giant added it is “testing Cybertruck vehicles around the world for final certification and validation.” “We can’t wait to start delivering it later this year,” Musk told investors Wednesday, referring to the Cybertruck. On July 15, Tesla tweeted a photo of the first Tesla Cybertruck made at its Austin plant. Tesla stock responded jumping 3.2%. The company also said it continues to “make progress” on its next generation platform. Since the Tesla investor day in early March, the company has remained mostly silent on its next generation vehicle, to be produced at its new plant in Mexico. At the annual shareholder meeting, Tesla unveiled a vehicle silhouette. The Long-Awaited Semi Hauler Unveiled In early December, Tesla unveiled its long-awaited Semi, an 18-wheel, long-haul electric freight truck, five years after it was first announced. However, in March, Tesla ordered a voluntary recall of 35 Semi trucks due to a parking brake issue. Tesla began delivering its long-haul Semi trucks to PepsiCo (PEP) in December. Further, Musk has indicated there are plans to build out a charging network for long-haul trucks. Musk did not specify how much the eighteen-wheeler costs. The Semi is capable of traveling an estimated 500 miles per charge. It can accelerate from zero to 60 in 20 seconds, Tesla says. The company expects to ramp production over the next year and aims to deliver 50,000 units in 2024. Before the recall, PepsiCo planned to deploy 36 Tesla Semi trucks, with 15 in Modesto and 21 in Sacramento. Pepsi placed its order for 100 EVs when the Semi was first announced in 2017. Tesla is currently under investigation by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over possible seat belt failures. Regulators are also probing the EV giant over steering-wheel issues and driver-assistance concerns. Is Tesla Stock A Buy? TSLA stock has an official cup-with-handle buy point of 299.29 on a deep consolidation going back to last September. However, TSLA has been pulling back since second-quarter financials on July 19. Tesla stock declined 4.4% to 242.65 last week. That move undercut support at the stock’s 50-day, 10-week moving average, finishing August 11 6.7% below that technical level of support. Finishing the week more than 2% below the 10-week is a significant sell signal, according to IBD analysis. Tesla continued downward this week, dropping 8% so far. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management sold a total of 119,030 shares over four consecutive sessions. On Tuesday, Wood sold $438,896 worth of Tesla stock, according to the company’s daily trade disclosure. Cathie Wood unloaded $2.15 million in TSLA on Monday. On Friday, the Cathie Wood firm sold $7.7 million in Tesla stock. ARK Invest kicked off its recent Tesla dump with more than 76,000 shares for about $18.75 million on Thursday. Separately, David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management disclosed in an SEC filing that it sold its Tesla stock stake in Q2. Appaloosa had started the Tesla position in Q1. Tesla stock ranks fourth in IBD’s automaker industry group. It has a 95 Composite Rating out of 99. Tesla has a 84 Relative Strength Rating and its EPS Rating is 94 out of 99. The market status is showing a “uptrend under pressure.” Tesla stock is not a buy right now. Please follow Kit Norton on Twitter @KitNorton for more coverage. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE",

      "title": "Grimes says her and Elon Musk’s three-year-old child X ‘knows a lot about rockets’",
      "text": "Grimes has opened up about raising her children with ex, Elon Musk, with the musician revealing that their three-year-old son “knows a lot about rockets”. The singer, 35, spoke candidly about co-parenting with the Tesla CEO during her cover story interview with Wired, published on 8 August. Along with their three-year-old, X Æ A-12 - who goes by “X” - the former couple shares a one-year-old daughter, Exa Dark Sideræl, who goes by “Y”. While speaking to Wired, Grimes was asked about Musk’s “weird kind of protégé thing going on” with their son, as he’s taken him to “meetings” and work events before. However, Grimes said that she’s “here for that” relationship between the father and son, before explaining that they share common interests. “X knows a lot about rockets,” she said. “It’s crazy. He knows more about rockets than me.” She then specified that she and Musk have stopped giving X toys, since he “gets upset” if “they’re not anatomically correct”. However, the singer confessed that she’s been a little worried about her son’s interest in space, as she described his reaction to the Starship rocket exploding earlier this year. “He’s a little engineer, for sure. But his obsession with space is bordering on: ‘Is this healthy?’ When X saw Starship blow up, he had, like, a three-day PTSD meltdown,” Grimes recalled. “Every hour, he was waking up and going: ‘Starship …’ and I had to rub his back.” Grimes - who announced her split from Musk in 2022- shared that her daughter is “a little engineer too,” explaining: “She likes industrial shipping. She’s very strange.” As she continued to open up about co-parenting with her ex, she said that she’s “trying to find a great peer group,” or “other parents who are sort of like us and share similar values”. She went on to speak candidly about the different boundaries she wants to set as a parent. “I really care about having a very good relationship with my kids. I think I understand how to be a good parent to them,” she said. “Both enforcing discipline and being their friend. Who knows, maybe they’ll resent me and reject family culture, but I feel like they will not.” She also confessed that she’s “a little bit” worried about her children’s privilege, as their father holds the title as the richest person in the world. “I think their life is gonna be pretty intense,” she said. “Being Elon’s kid is not the same as being anyone’s kid. In my house, at least, I want it to be more of a crazy warehouse situation and a cool art space.” Grimes and Musk first met in 2018 when he direct messaged her on social media, where they then made the same pun about artificial intelligence. In September 2021, Musk revealed to Page Six that he and Grimes have “semi-separated” due to conflicting schedules and locations. Two months later, the pair welcomed their daughter together via surrogate. After the announcement made headlines, Grimes told Vanity Fair in March 2022 that she and Musk have a fluid, inexplicable partnership. However, she later made a clarification about the comment on Twitter, noting that while she and Musk had broken up since welcoming their daughter, “he’s my best friend and the love of my life”. Elsewhere in her interview with Wired, Grimes acknowledged that she’s learned a lot from her ex, specifically when it comes to leadership skills. “I learned from him, like, the best internship ever. People don’t like talking about Elon, but it was incredible to be right there watching all that SpaceX stuff happen,” she said. “That’s a master class in leadership and engineering and makes you understand how rare it is to have a leader of that quality.” Grimes continued to praise Musk’s management skills, adding: “Elon has an old-world kind of discipline I really respect. And I think it rubs a lot of people the wrong way. They don’t want to be in that hardcore zone. If you’re not consenting to being in that hardcore zone, I get it.” She also specified that Musk has “challenged” her a lot, and taught her about running her own company and team. When asked what her ex learned from her, she said that she’s helped him “have more fun”. “I try to soften him up, to build family culture,” she said. “And he steals a lot of my memes.”",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Elon Musk said Sunday that he plans to change the logo of Twitter to an “X” from the famous blue bird, marking what would be the latest big change since he bought the social media platform for $44 billion last year. In a series of posts on his Twitter account starting just after 12 a.m. ET, Twitter’s owner said that he’s looking to make the change worldwide as soon as Monday. “And soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,” Musk wrote on his account. The change isn’t surprising given Musk’s long history with the name “X,” says Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce. The billionaire Tesla CEO tweeted last October that “buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Musk’s rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., is commonly known as SpaceX. And in 1999, Musk founded a startup called X.com, an online financial services company now known as PayPal. “Not sure what subtle clues gave it way, but I like the letter X,” Musk tweeted Sunday. But the change on Twitter was met with sharp criticism on the social media platform. The change will be very confusing to a huge chunk of the Twitter’s audience, which has been already souring on the social platform given a slew of other major changes Musk has made, Adamson said. “They won’t get it,” he said. “It’s a fitting end to a phenomenal unwinding of an iconic brand and business.” Earlier this month, Musk put new curfews on his digital town square, a move that met with sharp criticism that it could drive away more advertisers and undermine its cultural influence as a trendsetter. The higher tweet-viewing threshold is part of an $8-per-month subscription service that Musk rolled out earlier this year in an attempt to boost Twitter revenue. Revenue has dropped sharply since Musk took over the company and laid off roughly three-fourths of the workforce to slash costs and avoid bankruptcy. In May, Musk hired longtime NBC Universal executive Linda Yaccarino as Twitter’s CEO. Luring advertisers is essential for Musk and Twitter after many fled in the early months after his takeover of the social media platform, fearing damage to their brands in the enveloping chaos. Advertisers have cut back on spending partly because of changes Musk has made that has allowed for more hateful content to flourish and that has offended a wider part of the platform’s audience. Musk said in late April that advertisers had returned, but provided no specifics. Musk’s move to change Twitter’s logo to an “X” also comes as Twitter faces new competition from Meta’s new app, Threads, launched earlier this month. It has been seen as an alternative for those who have been upset with Twitter. Threads is being billed as a text-based version of Meta’s photo-sharing app Instagram that the company has said offers “a new, separate space for real-time updates and public conversations.” In the first five days of its launch, 100 million people had signed up for Threads, according to a post on Threads by Instagram head Adam Mosseri.

      "title": "Mark Zuckerberg confirms he is \"moving on\" from cage fight with Elon Musk",
      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg has poured cold water on a potential fight against Elon Musk as he doesn't believe his tech rival is serious about it. Zuckerberg and Musk were in talks to fight in a cage with UFC president Dana White offering his helping hand to make it happen. The UFC have been selling custom t-shirts to promote the fight as White held talks with Italy's Minister of Culture about potentially holding the fight in Rome's Colosseum. The mega-fight is unlikely to take place for now as Zuckerberg has accused Tesla boss Musk of making several excuses. \"I think we can all agree Elon isn't serious and it's time to move on. I offered a real date. Dana White offered to make this a legit competition for charity,\" Zuckerberg wrote on threads. Do you think Mark Zuckerberg vs Elon Musk will ever happen? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below \"Elon won't confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead. If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me. Otherwise, time to move on. I'm going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously.\" The Meta co-founder's comments come as a surprise as Musk gave an update about the fight last week in which he wrote: \"The fight will be managed by my and Zuck’s foundations (not UFC). Livestream will be on this platform and Meta. \"Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome, so nothing modern at all. I spoke to the PM of Italy and Minister of Culture. They have agreed on an epic location. Everything done will pay respect to the past and present of Italy, all proceeds go to veterans.\" Zuckerberg is a big fan of MMA and even recently built an octagon in his back garden, much to the annoyance of his wife. He recently won medals in a Brazilian jiu-jitsu tournament and has trained with UFC champions Israel Adesanya and Alexander Volkanovski. Zuckerberg hinted that he could still compete in a cage fight against a different opponent amid the Musk bout collapsing. \"I love this sport and I've been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me,\" Zuckerberg added. \"If he ever agrees on an actual date, you'll hear it from me. Until then, please assume anything he says has not been agreed on. \"Not holding my breath for Elon, but I'll share details on my next fight when I'm ready. When I compete, I want to do it in a way that puts a spotlight on the elite athletes at the top of the game. You do that by working with professional orgs like the UFC or ONE to pull this off well and create a great card.\"",

      "title": "\"Send me location\": What do we know about the cage fight between Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk?",
      "text": "“SEND ME LOCATION.” With these three words, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg responded to the challenge laid down by X owner Elon Musk that the two billionaires should have a cage fight. The tension between the two has been simmering for a long time before this. In 2016, a satellite of Zuckerberg’s was destroyed in a failed Space X rocket launch. The two have also clashed over their differing opinions of AI, and Musk has been critical of Facebook for a number of years. Musk officially threw down the gauntlet in June, telling Zuckerberg that he was “up for a cage fight”, following the announcement of Meta’s “Twitter killer” app Threads. While Threads hasn’t yet lived up to the potential ascribed to it – the app announced earlier this month that it had lost over half of its users – its legacy, a titanic clash described by Dana White as being potentially “the biggest fight in the history of combat sports” remains. However, all has not been smooth sailing in the organising of this gladatorial bout. While on 22 June, Musk suggested the Vegas Octagon as a venue - which hosted seven of Conor McGregor’s nine pay-per-view UFC fights – Zuckerberg says that he hasn’t received any confirmation from the South African tech mogul that the fight will go ahead. “I’m ready today. I suggested Aug 26 when he first challenged, but he hasn’t confirmed. Not holding my breath,” he said in a post on Threads. Musk, for his part, has been inconsistent in his commitment to the event. While he was the one who initially suggested it, and was the one to suggest the venue, he has since cast doubt over proceedings owing to health concerns. On Monday 7 June, he tweeted that he may need surgery before the fight can happen. With no word from either side since, it is unclear at present whether the public will be denied such a sought after spectacle. Nevertheless, it’s worth having a gander at our combatants. The challengers Who are our contenders, and what do they each bring to the table? Over the last two years, Mark Zuckerberg has thrown himself headfirst into the world of mixed martial arts, particularly Brazilian jiu jitsu. Popularised in the west by the Gracie family, a Brazilian martial arts dynasty, the sport has grown into a global phenomenon, being as it is one of the key components of mixed martial arts. The 39-year-old has been one of the main faces of the social media and tech industries for nearly 20 years. While he started as one of the owners and founders of Facebook, this has since expanded into the Meta empire, spanning Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. If you communicate with someone online over the course of the day, you more than likely do so with one of his products. Zuckerberg has taken to Brazilian jiu jitsu with the single-mindedness that has characterised his career. He has competed in numerous competitions in California over the past 18 months, often with success, and has most recently installed an octagon in his back garden to prepare for his greatest challenge: Elon Musk. View this post on Instagram Zuckerberg’s opponent’s career, by contrast, has been slightly more eclectic. The scion of a South African mining family, one of Musk’s first companies, the online bank X.com, merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. After having been replaced as the company’s CEO by Peter Thiel in 2001, he went on to form Space X in 2002, becoming its CEO and chief engineer. In 2004, he became involved in Tesla, and in 2008 became the company’s CEO. He has since been involved in projects such as Neuralink – which aims to integrate human brains with AI – and the Boring Company, which plans to construct tunnels under US cities to alleviate traffic congestion. In terms of his physical prowess, Musk is much more of an unknown quantity than Zuckerberg. While the South African has a height and weight advantage over his American opponent, he is also 12 years older. It is also unclear if his combat readiness is in line with Zuckerberg’s. While Musk has said that he is “lifting weights throughout the day, preparing for the fight”, he has been less clear on what fighting style he plans to employ. He has intimated that he intends to utilise a “WWE”, or professional wrestling approach, and has also claimed that he at one time practices judo, Kyokushin karate, and “no rules street fighting”. Despite his apparent disadvantage when it comes to Zuckerberg in ability, he has remained committed to the bout. It’s a civilized form of war. Men love war.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 6, 2023 Musk has stated that it will be live-streamed on X, née Twitter, and that all proceeds will be donated to a “charity for veterans”. Zuckerberg hit back, asking “shouldn’t we use a more reliable platform that can actually raise money for charity?”. However, as of now, an actual time, date and location for the fight has not been set. Whether or not the clash does go ahead, one thing is for certain: both of these men may have far too much time on their hands.",

      "title": "Zuckerberg says Musk 'not serious' about cage fight",
      "text": "Elon Musk \"isn't serious\" about holding a cage fight and \"it's time to move on\", Mark Zuckerberg has said. In a post on his social media site Threads, the Meta boss said he had offered Mr Musk \"a real date\" but the rival entrepreneur had made excuses. Mr Musk had earlier on Sunday suggested on his own messaging site X, formerly known as Twitter, that he was willing to fight as early as Monday. The billionaires agreed to the bout in June, sparking huge media attention. But despite egging each other on for months, the rivals have yet to secure a date, raising doubts the fight will ever go ahead. The war of words was complicated by the launch of Threads in July, with the rival messaging app to X attracting more than 100 million sign-ups in less than a week. That number has fallen back, and X remains comfortably ahead with around 350 million users - but Mr Musk has threatened to sue Facebook for \"unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets\". Meta denies the claims. Last week, Mr Zuckerberg said he had proposed 26 August for the cage fight. Then in a twist on Friday, Italy's culture minister said that he had spoken to Mr Musk about hosting the showdown in the country as a charity event. Mr Musk suggested it would have \"an ancient Rome theme\". On Sunday, however, the Meta boss posted on Threads: \"Elon won't confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead. \"If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me. Otherwise, time to move on. I'm going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously.\" Responding on X, however, Mr Musk called the Meta boss a \"chicken\". Earlier, Mr Musk had posted a text message exchange on the messaging platform purportedly between himself and Mr Zuckerberg. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. In it he tells the Meta boss that he will be in Palo Alto, home to Meta's headquarters, on Monday and that the fight could be held in Mr Zuckerberg's Octagon, which is the eight-sided ring in which cage fights are held. Mr Musk continued: \"I have not been practicing much, apart from a brief bout with Lex Fridman [the computer scientist and podcast host] today. \"While I think it is very unlikely, l given our size difference, perhaps you are a modern day Bruce Lee and will somehow win.\" Elon Musk, 52, and Mark Zuckerberg, 39 are two of the world's most high-profile technology billionaires. The bizarre idea to fight each other started in June, when Mr Musk tweeted that he was \"up for a cage fight\" with Mr Zuckerberg. The Meta boss, who already has mixed martial arts (MMA) training and has recently won jiu-jitsu tournaments, simply responded with \"send me location\".",

X will be untenable for people like me, who are willing to share their identities. If he does this, I will have no choice but to retire from this site.” “If [Elon Musk] removes the ability to block concerted harassment by trolls or organized political entities, how will ‘X’ be any different from Jack Dorsey’s horrid Twitter?” Woods later posted. “Musk, whom I once championed, is only doing this to protect his advertisers anyway. Users of X are mere pawns to turn the site into an electronic shopping mall. The man I thought was a defender of free speech is just another greedy capitalist. Disappointing, but not surprising.” Musk responded directly to Woods, writing: “Then delete your account.” Then delete your account— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 20, 2023 Woods later posted a screenshot showing that Musk had blocked him after the interaction. “You[r] prerogative, sir, which is exactly my point,” Woods wrote. “Have a nice day.” Earlier in the day, Musk tweeted that he was using the “block” feature against those who want it to remain in order to prove a point. “Pretty fun blocking people who complain that blocking is going away,” Musk wrote. “How does the medicine taste?” You prerogative, sir, which is exactly my point.

      "title": "Elon Musk’s X Rebrand Is Toxic Catnip to the Press  - POLITICO",
      "text": "If you accept the fact that the press corps is conflicted over Twitter, then you should have no trouble accepting that no matter what Elon Musk might do with the site, the press would be bawling about it because that’s the nature of its relationship with it. It’s no defense of Musk to assert that no matter what he does or doesn’t do with Twitter, he’ll be keelhauled for it. For example, if Musk had purchased Twitter and did nothing but kept the lights on, the complaint would have been, “Musk is letting the site atrophy.” “Where are the new features?” “He’s an absentee owner!” “Why did he even bother buying it?” Even if he had limited his changes to remodeling a few features and tossing new coats of paint on the hallways, traditionalists would have called for the department of historical preservation cops to arrest him. Twitter users by their nature tend toward conservatism. They want things to remain the same so they can recycle their complaints more effectively. But as we’ve seen, Musk’s big moves at the company have brought out the boo-birds, too. Musk has been condemned for charging for Twitter Blue, for restoring the accounts of the formerly banned, for suspending access to its API, for capping the number of tweets users can view per day, for rebranding Twitter as X, and all the rest. Even though Musk owns a controlling interest in Twitter, giving him every moral right to do with it as he pleases, his attempts at a makeover have earned him nothing but grief from the press. Musk’s inability to win for losing resembles the status of the owner of a major sports franchise. Dedicated sports fans, who share a lot with your average reporter or press commentator, scream bloody hell whether their team leads the league or is a doormat, whether its management hoards its current roster or spends wildly on new players. Tickets, no matter what their price, are too expensive. The food is bad. The manager or coach is a bum. This perennial dissatisfaction can be rooted in reality. For instance, the Kansas City Royals are an execrable team with a horrible front office. But the vehemence of the average sports fan — and the average Twitter observer in the press — stems not so much from objective conditions as they do from overidentification. Sports fans think of themselves as part of the team they love-hate. “We lost last night.” “We traded for Shohei Ohtani!’ “We’ll do better next year.” Likewise, the press overidentifies with Twitter, thinking of the service as an extension of their beings, which it sort of is, a place where they can polish and display their egos, their sacred space around the cosmic water cooler where they can defend and project their superior status. Twitter has become the press corps’ mirror, the venue for their daily affirmation by each other and the masses. Did people retweet their clever quip? Did the latest piece they wrote and tweeted out get many comments? Have they gained important followers? Or lost some? Are they being shadow-banned? Twitter has become the press corps’ universal measure of status, and no matter what Musk or anybody else does or doesn’t do with it, they’ll squawk. Ever since Musk took tenancy at Twitter, press sages and scolds have been urging their colleagues to resign their accounts and spend their time on more worthwhile diversions. While there are good arguments for this — you might get more work done and avoid unnecessary street brawls — there’s a way to use Twitter or follow a sports team without thinking of it as a personal appendage. Just as you don’t have to watch every game and listen to every sports talk segment on your team to “follow” a team, you can dip into and out of Twitter judicially. Twitter can be great, but it’s not so great that it deserves the keys to the car and the right to drive us wherever it (or Elon Musk) wants to take us. The best policy for the press would be to detach itself from Twitter the way a drinker who overenjoys his nightly bourbon should when he starts to view everything through the bottom of his glass. So what if Musk is destroying Twitter? That would be a fine response for the press corps to whatever novel or nutty thing he’s done with the site this week. Let him spend his billions and concede that in becoming X, the destroyer of Twitter, he just might be doing us all a favor. ****** Instead of tweeting, send email to [email protected].

      "title": "Elon Musk’s Vision: X Transformation into the World’s Largest Financial Institution",
      "text": "In a bold proclamation, Elon Musk, the eccentric billionaire and tech entrepreneur, has set his sights on X, formerly known as Twitter, as the future largest financial institution in the world. With an immense user base of around 500 million people, Twitter’s evolution under Musk’s guidance has the potential to reshape the global financial landscape. The Current Financial Landscape: The largest North American bank is JP Morgan Chase, boasting a vast network serving approximately 70 million households and 5 million small businesses. Meanwhile, in Canada, TD Bank caters to around 27 million customers. These traditional banking institutions have long dominated the financial sector, but Musk’s audacious plans seek to challenge their hegemony. Elon Musk has a history of success in revolutionizing industries, having previously developed the widely-used online payment platform PayPal. His entrepreneurial acumen and innovative mindset have led him to envision Twitter, or “X,” as the financial juggernaut of the future. Musk is known for thinking big and daring to pursue seemingly audacious goals, earning him the reputation of a “mad genius.” Despite occasional setbacks, Musk’s track record of success highlights his determination to accomplish groundbreaking feats. One of Musk’s ambitious goals is to create the American version of WeChat. In China, WeChat has evolved from a simple messaging app into a comprehensive ecosystem encompassing social networking, e-commerce, and financial services. Musk believes that by integrating cryptocurrency and other financial services into Twitter’s fabric, it can transform into a global financial powerhouse. The potential of Twitter, now “X,” to disrupt the traditional banking industry cannot be overlooked. With a massive user base already in place, Musk can leverage Twitter’s reach to introduce a wide array of financial services and products to hundreds of millions, if not a billion, of users. As the platform evolves, the influence of traditional brick-and-mortar banks may wane as customers increasingly turn to digital solutions for their financial needs. Musk’s inclination towards cryptocurrency is no secret, and he has made significant contributions to the field, notably with his interest in DogeCoin. He aims to create an innovative and secure digital financial infrastructure by incorporating cryptocurrencies into Twitter’s financial ecosystem. While an initial public offering (IPO) may not be on the immediate horizon, the potential valuation of Twitter (X) as a financial institution is staggering. Considering Musk’s past success and his penchant for ambitious ventures, Twitter’s value could reach the trillion-dollar mark, disrupting the financial world as we know it. As the world moves towards digitalization and embraces cryptocurrencies, traditional banking institutions face a formidable challenge from the tech titan. The success of X’s financial evolution is not a question of “if” but “when,” and its impact on the banking industry could be revolutionary. As Musk pushes the boundaries of innovation, the world watches in anticipation to witness how big of a disruptor Twitter (X) will become.",

      "title": "\"I've Been Ready Since...\": Mark Zuckerberg On Cage Fight With Elon Musk",
      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg, head of Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc., threw cold water on claims by Elon Musk that the two billionaires are working out plans for a cage match in Rome. \"I love this sport and I've been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Meta's Threads blogging site. \"If he ever agrees on an actual date, you'll hear it from me. Until then, please assume anything he says has not been agreed on.\" Zuckerberg, a martial arts enthusiast, was responding to an earlier Musk post that purported to give specifics on the much-anticipated CEO duel. Musk wrote that the fight would be overseen by his and Zuckerberg's respective foundations, as opposed to a professional organization like the UFC. According to Musk's post, the fight would be livestreamed on both Meta and X, the platform formerly known as Twitter that he owns. \"Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome, so nothing modern at all,\" Musk wrote. \"I spoke to the PM of Italy and Minister of Culture. They have agreed on an epic location.\" Italy's culture minister confirmed that he spoke with Musk about an event. Musk also wrote that all proceeds from the fight would \"go to veterans,\" though he didn't specify a particular foundation or organization. The competition between Musk, 52, and Zuckerberg, 39, has intensified since the July launch of Meta's Threads, designed as a direct rival to X. Threads reached 100 million users less than a week after its launch, benefiting from Meta's immense reach. Musk, the world's richest person, first challenged Zuckerberg to the fight in late June. The Meta chief responded by asking for the location to meet, but Musk health issues have added a wrinkle. On Aug. 6, Musk posted that he would receive an MRI of his neck and upper back. Then on Friday, the billionaire said he had a problem with his shoulder blade that might require minor surgery. \"Recovery will only take a few months,\" Musk said.

      "title": "Elon Musk Killing Twitter May Have Done Us All a Huge Favour",
      "text": "Elon Musk’s decision, which seemed to have come out of left field, to replace Twitter’s blue bird with an “X” may not be a death blow, but it is another nail in the coffin. Basically, Twitter’s press release read, “As of Monday, July 24th, Twitter will be known simply as X.” While questionable, this is Musk’s boldest move since purchasing the social media site last October for $44 billion. Predictably, Twitter’s constantly irritable users condemned the move as irresponsible, risky, and wrongheaded. Founder of Meta, Mark Zuckerberg, undoubtedly is chuckling at the boost rebranding Twitter as ‘X” will bring to his newly launched Twitter rival Threads, a venture he founded to capitalize on the opportunity Twitter’s decline under Musk’s ownership presents. Twitter’s core strength is its relevancy. It never made money, nor did it ever become the most prominent social network. However, people immediately go to Twitter to learn more when something happens. Twitter’s appeal lies in its ability to collect information about the present moment, whether it is the death of a notable member of society, a weather event, or traffic. Due to Musk’s missteps, Twitter is losing its relevancy and giving other platforms an opportunity. (e.g., TikTok introducing text-only posts.) Zuckerberg wants threads to be friendly and news-free, which is all nice and good, but is this what most social media users want? Such a business model does not satisfy the primary reason for being on social media, which is to get news and updates. Furthermore, Threads lacks the features that make Twitter “Twitter.” There are no hashtags to find like-minded individuals or groups. There is no direct messaging, no desktop version, and no way to view only the feeds of those you follow. Twitter is widely used for informative purposes. It is also a place where people can post relatively freely, which unfortunately has attracted people looking to spread fake news and conspiracy theories or troll to express their anger against those with differing views, making Twitter a toxic digital soup. As with any platform, Twitter faces the same tension regarding how much to moderate content, not just for users who want hate speech curtailed but also for advertisers who want to avoid risking their brand’s reputation. Instead of addressing this ongoing tension, Musk drove Twitter further into a free-for-all direction. Musk has been quoted saying that Twitter’s increasing moderation was one of the reasons he chose to acquire the company and transform it into a “free speech” platform. Instead of criticizing Musk for his poor business decisions, we should be praising him. By making Twitter increasingly unappealing and frustrating, Musk has given millions of people a golden opportunity to reduce their social media addiction. The 37% of Canadians who visit Twitter monthly can now eliminate this time thief. Twitter’s impending demise — yes, I could be wrong; after all, Musk has a business success record far beyond mine — is a chance to reduce the need for the dopamine hit that Twitter gives. The last thing anyone should do is replace the gift Musk is giving us with another social media time-sucking, anxiety-inducing platform, which Threads is no different; it steals time and self-worth. When a product sucks, users leave or use it less. By making Twitter less useful and fun, Musk is forcing us to reduce our dependence on his product, which is a gift. Imagine he was in the cigarette business and suddenly rationed our access to only 10 cigarettes a day unless you paid extra for a pack stamped with a blue checkmark. Now, smokers (READ: addicts) are faced with two choices. Option A: Switch to a similar cigarette company such as Threads, Mastodon, BlueSky CounterSocial or Discord. Option B: Drastically reduce smoking. Most will consider Option B. We are increasingly living our lives online. According to Statista, Canada had 3.3 million Twitter users in 2012. By 2019, the number had risen to 7.6 million. Today, there are approximately 7.9 million Twitter users in Canada. Additionally, according to Statista, 45% of Canadians use Twitter daily. Due to its addictive properties, social media has rewired our brains. Collectively, we are more angst-ridden, less self-assured, less socially skilled, and more withdrawn today than we were post-social media. Indeed, consciously uncoupling from a 24/7 short-content service has downsides and will be met with FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). I have yet to quit Twitter. However, in my defence, I have not joined Threads or any other alternatives. Since Musk announced that non-paying users would be limited in what they can see on Twitter, my phone shows that my “Twitter time” has plummeted. I may not have kicked my Twitter habit completely, but by fundamentally spoiling his product Musk is setting me on the road to recovery. Fingers crossed, I have the discipline not to pick up another social media platform habit. ____________________________________________ Nick Kossovan, a self-described connoisseur of human psychology, writes about what’s on his mind from Toronto.

      "title": "In His Latest Threat to Public Safety, Elon Musk Says Twitter Will Remove Option to Block Users",
      "text": "Twitter, (recently rebranded as X) appears to be taking another turn for the worse as Elon Musk claimed on Friday that he is removing the Block feature from the app. If Musk goes through with it, users will reportedly still have the option to mute other profiles from appearing on their feeds, but the option to block unwanted followers from seeing your activity may become a thing of the past. Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a profile run by Tesla aficionados, asked in a Tweet on Friday: “Is there ever a reason to block vs mute someone? Give your reasons.” Musk replied to the post, claiming: “Block is going to be deleted as a ‘feature,’ except for DMs.” Aside from his post, Musk has not officially confirmed that the Block feature will be removed, nor has he indicated when or why, simply saying in a follow-up response that the Block feature “makes no sense.” Musk has been all talk before, such as with his proposed fight against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg which ended with no follow through on Musk’s part. However, the ramifications of following through with the fight would hurt only Musk, while eliminating one of Twitter’s key safety features would affect all Twitter users by opening them up to harassment, threats, and stalking. Musk’s announcement comes as online hate and harassment continues to rise with 52% of adults reporting they have been harassed online in their lifetime, according to an annual survey by the Anti-Defamation League. “Online hate and harassment is a really serious problem,” Jordan Kraemer, director of research at ADL, told USA Today. “Even when it stays online, it’s hugely damaging and the people to whom it’s the most damaging are often those who are not in a position of power to make the necessary changes.” Yet, the person who is responsible for making those changes is, in fact, making it worse. More concerns abounded when Musk dismantled Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council. By removing the council Larry Magid, the CEO of children’s safety nonprofit ConnectSafely told Politico: “Twitter will lose the opportunity to learn from a diverse group of experts ranging from free speech absolutists to people who are extremely protective of children and people’s privacy.” Prior to taking over Twitter in October of last year, Musk addressed employees for the first time in June, raising his alleged worries about harassment on the platform. However, his more concerning comment, was that all content decisions should be determined by whether the content posted on Twitter is entertaining, two unnamed employees told The Washington Post at the time. The big question is why Musk wants to ditch the option to block people in the first place. Twitter’s advertising revenue is likely a factor in all this. As of mid-July, Twitter has lost more than half of its advertising revenue since Musk took over the company. This has led Twitter to seek out more and more unsavory advertisers that fill timelines with ads for crypto scams and snake oil supplements prompting many users to publicly encourage blocking advertisers. At the same time, a cottage industry of plugins that automatically block users who subscribe to Twitter Blue has popped up in recent months. If Musk does move forward with removing the Block feature, Twitter is likely to be in violation of Google and Apple’s app store policies which require apps to allow users to block content. Apple’s App Store guidelines page explicitly states that apps must have “the ability to block abusive users from the service.” Likewise, Google’s guidelines say all apps must provide “an in-app system for blocking UGC and users.”",

      "title": "Elon Musk admits his $44 billion X takeover 'may fail, as so many have predicted'",
      "text": "Elon Musk has acknowledged that his $44 billion takeover of X “may fail” – a stark admission that came as he faced fresh public outrage over a decision to eliminate the social media site’s “block” feature. Musk commented on X’s uncertain future came even as Threads, the rival text-based social media platform launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta last month, prepared to roll out a web version in its latest effort to lure users. “The sad truth is that there are no great ‘social networks’ right now,” Musk said. “We may fail, as so many have predicted, but we will try our best to make there be at least one.” The X owner, who is worth an estimated $225.5 billion, infuriated users last Friday by revealing they would no longer be allowed to block accounts, except in the case of direct messages. Musk argued that the block feature “makes no sense” and said users would have to make do with simply “muting” accounts from appearing on their timeline. The move triggered immediate pushback, with Monica Lewinsky among those who urged Musk and X CEO Linda Yaccarino to reconsider nixing the feature. “Please rethink removing the block feature. as an anti-bullying activist (and target of harassment) i can assure you it’s a critical tool to keep people safe online,” Lewinsky said. Despite his apparent doubts about X’s future success, Musk poked fun at users who had raised a stink about his decision to get rid of the block function. “Pretty fun blocking people who complain that blocking is going away. How does the medicine taste?” Musk wrote on Sunday. The criticism was one of the multiple headaches that emerged for X over the weekend. On Saturday, a glitch on X’s platform caused pictures and videos that were uploaded to Twitter prior to 2015 to disappear from the site. One of the pictures to be temporarily erased was comedian’s Ellen DeGeneres famous selfie from the 2014 Oscars alongside Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Meryl Steep. That image was later restored, though the glitch appeared to persist for other media. “More vandalism from @elonmusk,” said user Tom Coates, who was among the first to flag the issue. “Twitter has now removed all media posted before 2014. Thats – so far – almost a decade of pictures and videos from the early 2000s removed from the service.” Separately, a report from Mashable revealed that 42% of Musk’s roughly 153 million followers had zero followers of their own. More than 100 million accounts that follow Musk have tweeted less than 10 times. The data suggests that many of Musk’s followers have inactive accounts – and raised the possibility that some could be “bots.” The billionaire famously vowed to eliminate all bots from Twitter as part of his plans to rejuvenate the site. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg’s plan to roll out a web version of Threads added additional pressure on X. While Threads has lost more than half of its user base since its debut, it is still considered the most significant challenge to date for Musk’s platform. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri confirmed on Friday that Threads’ web version was close to a debut. “It’s a little bit buggy right now, you don’t want it just yet,” Mosseri said. “As soon as it is ready we will share it with everybody else.” If X were to fail at some point in the future, it would mark one of the costliest business disasters in history. Musk was forced to sell off a significant chunk of Tesla stock to fund the $44 billion deal. Earlier this month, Yaccarino claimed that X is close to breaking even from a revenue perspective following Musk’s extensive cost-cutting measures, including mass layoffs.",

      "title": "X CEO Linda Yaccarino touts 'autonomy' from Elon Musk, says 'lawful but awful' posts 'de-amplified'",
      "text": "X CEO Linda Yaccarino emphasized that she has “autonomy” from the platform’s owner Elon Musk and stressed the site has “de-amplified’ the “lawful but awful” posts that have scared off advertisers. Yaccarino, the former NBCUniversal advertising chief who took over the company once known as Twitter in May, said during a wide-ranging interview Thursday that she and Musk have “very clear” roles at X – with the billionaire focused on “product design” and “new technology” while she handles “running the company, from partnerships to sales to legal to finance.” “I have a great partner in Elon. It’s been eight incredibly supportive weeks,” Yaccarino told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” “Our roles are very clear and the way Elon and I talked about it before I started was that while our lanes are really clear and defined, we are brought together by the belief in what we’re trying to achieve.” The dynamic between Musk and Yaccarino has been a subject of intense scrutiny since she inherited the difficult task of steering a massive overhaul that included an exodus of advertisers and a resulting loss of revenue since the mogul paid $44 billion for the social media site last year. Yaccarino’s task as CEO grew more complicated after Musk surprised the public by ditching Twitter’s brand in favor of the “X” name. Yaccarino said X has made significant strides in rebuilding its base of major advertisers, with Coca-Cola and Visa among the notable brands that have purportedly returned to the fold. The X boss argued that the site is a “much healthier and safer platform than it was a year ago” and touted the company’s policy of “freedom of speech, not reach,” where content that’s considered “lawful but awful” gets “labeled” to protect brand safety for ad clients. “You get de-amplified, which means it cannot be shared and it is certainly demonetized,” Yaccarino said. “So they are protected from the risk of being next to that content.” Yaccarino said X is “close” to breaking even financially – a point previously made by Musk – and added that the company is hiring for new roles. At present, X has about 1,500 employees, or less than a quarter of its workforce before Musk bought Twitter and began mass layoffs last fall. Some experts warned that Musk’s decision to nix Twitter’s iconic blue bird logo could further spook advertisers who were already wary of his light approach to content moderation. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives likened the name change to the “New Coke” marketing blunder of the 1980s. But Yaccarino defended the change, stating that it was necessary to reflect plans to transform into a so-called “everything app” with an array of services beyond simple text-based posts. “If you stay Twitter or you stay whatever your previous brand is, change tends to be only incremental and you get graded by a legacy report card. At X, we think about what’s possible, not the incremental change about what can’t be done.” Yaccarino also addressed the potential cage match between Musk and his rival, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, telling CNBC that “Elon is training” for a possible bout. She described a cage match as a “great brand sponsorship opportunity” for X. Musk has said that the match will be live-streamed on X, though he may require surgery on his back before it can proceed.",

      "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Dampens Enthusiasm for Elon Musk Cage Match",
      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg alleges that Elon Musk is unwilling to commit to a specific date for their anticipated cage match, citing a lack of seriousness on the part of the Twitter CEO. “I think we can all agree Elon isn’t serious and it’s time to move on,” Zuckerberg wrote on his Threads social platform. “I offered a real date... Elon won’t confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead.” Musk quickly responded on Twitter, now known as X, saying: “Zuck is a chicken”. The Tesla boss said he would head to Silicon Valley on Monday: “Can’t wait to bang on his door tomorrow.”In response to a user's suggestion that Zuckerberg might be hesitant about the match, Musk made a reference to a well-known American fast-food chain recognized for its chicken products. “He can’t eat at Chick-fil-A because that would be cannibalism,” Musk posted. The two prominent figures in the tech industry have engaged in a series of exchanges on social media regarding their intentions to participate in a highly anticipated charity match. In a recent statement on Friday, Musk revealed that the bout is slated to occur in Italy. This decision comes in the wake of Italian authorities verifying ongoing discussions about organizing a significant charitable occasion. “I spoke to the PM of Italy and minister of culture,” Musk wrote, referring to Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister. “They have agreed on an epic location.” In response, Zuckerberg posted a photo of himself shirtless and pinning down an opponent in his “backyard octagon”. A martial arts enthusiast who has taken part in jiujitsu competitions, Zuckerberg said: “I love this sport and I’ve been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me.” “If he ever agrees on an actual date, you’ll hear it from me. Until then, please assume anything he says has not been agreed on.” Gennaro Sangiuliano, the Italian culture minister confirmed speaking to Musk about “how to organise a great charity event evoking history” but said any match “will not be held in Rome”. Mr Sangiuliano said any event with Musk would raise “a huge sum, many millions of euros, (that) will be donated to two important Italian paediatric hospitals”. The two technology magnates, who have engaged in occasional indirect exchanges, transitioned into direct competitors following the launch of Zuckerberg's Meta and its Threads platform, which bears resemblance to Twitter, in early July. Musk noted on Friday that he may need to undergo “minor surgery” to resolve a “problem with my right shoulder blade rubbing against my ribs.” “Recovery will only take a few months,” he added. The world’s richest person has a titanium plate holding two vertebrae together but said Friday it is currently “not an issue”.",

      "title": "Elon Musk’s next target is your finances. The government may say no.  - POLITICO",
      "text": "“As a big company, you have a bullseye on your back — from the average consumer, from politicians,” said Morgan Beller, who co-created the failed Facebook crypto venture first known as Libra. “You have to ask for permission, not forgiveness.” And that’s just not Musk’s style, as evidenced by his plan to face off with Zuckerberg in hand-to-hand combat. “You have a cowboy at the helm of a big company,” Beller said. “So, who’s to say what he will try to do or not do?” Zuckerberg’s experience revealed broad concerns in Washington and Brussels about the intermingling of social media and finance that still linger. He faced fatal opposition even as he pledged to delay the project and address officials’ objections. It’s questionable whether Musk, who has long taken a more combative approach to dealing with regulators — and who has also become a political lightning rod — would fare any better. “My guess: He’d run into the same situation that Zuckerberg ran into,” said Rep. Bill Foster, an Illinois Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, in an interview. Musk’s exact vision is just now taking shape. He wrote last month that the app will soon move to add “comprehensive communications” and become a conduit for “your entire financial world.” X has secured money-transmission licenses in some states and is reportedly eyeing stock trading features. It would expand an empire that — unlike Zuckerberg’s — also includes dominant businesses in private space travel and satellite communication, which have helped make him a singular geopolitical force. “It’s possible to become the biggest financial institution in the world,” Musk said of X in March. It would be a second act in financial services for Musk, who cut his teeth in business with the online payment platform PayPal. The company was formed out of a merger between Musk’s earlier X.com and Confinity, a startup co-launched by billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel. He briefly led PayPal before being ousted as CEO in 2000. Zuckerberg turned to another PayPal alum, David Marcus, to help develop and roll out the plan for Facebook’s Libra digital currency in 2019. The company, now known as Meta, touted the crypto venture as a powerful new payments system that would give consumers around the world a better way to move their money. The project, which was rebranded as Diem, folded in 2022. The scope of Zuckerberg’s ambition — the potential creation of a private money system linked to one of the world’s largest social networks — spooked lawmakers and regulators at the highest levels. Aaron Klein, a former Treasury Department official who now serves as a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he suspects that Musk “will be more careful and surgical” in how he approaches expanding X into finance. But “Musk’s history is to think pretty big,” he said. “The bigger you think, the more regulatory tripwires there are.” If Musk opts to follow Zuckerberg into crypto, he is likely to face the same reception, according to lawmakers. “That would receive its share of scrutiny,” said Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), who leads a House subcommittee on digital assets. “Just like you witnessed back four years ago when Zuckerberg and David Marcus were here talking about their failed Libra project.” Spokespeople for X did not respond to a request for comment. Musk’s potential move into financial services could also garner opposition from traditional banks, which urged lawmakers to crack down on Libra in 2019. They have fought for years to fend off the encroachment of big tech companies into banking. “The banking industry is on high alert from this,” Foster said. “They see the huge natural advantage of any organization with a big user base for social media trying to leverage that user base for payment transactions.” Another fundamental takeaway from Zuckerberg’s failure: Don’t wait to lobby Washington on your vision. Zuckerberg and Facebook were forced to engage in extensive political damage control after their Libra rollout left policymakers with numerous questions. At the height of the uproar, Zuckerberg himself testified before Congress to allay concerns but it was too little, too late. “The big lesson from Mark Zuckerberg’s failed Libra experiment was that they didn’t do any of the upfront work in Washington, D.C., getting regulators or lawmakers comfortable with their idea,” said former SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar, now with the Milken Institute think tank. “The Silicon Valley approach of ‘move fast and break things’ does not work once you get into anything related to financial services.” It may require an approach that’s uncharacteristic for Musk, who has ridiculed the agencies that oversee his companies, including Tesla, often skirting federal regulations with minimal consequences. Musk paid $20 million to settle securities fraud charges brought by the SEC — Wall Street’s top cop — but is now in a legal battle with the agency over the terms of the deal. He plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. “I do not respect the SEC,” Musk said following the 2018 settlement, later calling the agency “bastards.” Beller, the Libra co-creator, said Facebook tried to lay the groundwork with regulators but securing approval from entities around the globe led to “death by a thousand paper cuts.” “Can he brute force his way?” Beller said of Musk. “Maybe.”",

      "title": "Elon Musk&#8217;s Bombshell On Twitter Brand, Logo",
      "text": "New Delhi: Elon Musk, Twitter owner, dropped a bombshell today saying that he plans to rebrand the platform, reflecting the billionaire’s vision to create a “super app” like China’s WeChat. “And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,” Musk tweeted. “If a good enough X logo is posted tonight, we’ll make go live worldwide tomorrow,” he said in another tweet And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2023 Musk posted an version of a what he wants the logo to look like, and later in a Twitter Spaces audio chat replied “Yes” when asked if the Twitter logo will change, adding that “it should have been done a long time ago”. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2023 Twitter’s website says its current logo, depicting a blue bird, is “our most recognizable asset,” adding “That’s why we’re so protective of it.” The bird was temporarily replaced in April by Dogecoin’s Shiba Inu dog, which ended up helping add as much as $4 billion to the meme coin’s market value. The billionaire has had the name ‘X’ on his mind for some time now. Musk bought Twitter last year for $44 billion and merged the company into an entity called X Corp. While welcoming new CEO Linda Yaccarino in April, he had tweeted, “Looking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X, the everything app”. In October, he had said, “Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app”. Twitter has suffered repeated technical failures since Tesla tycoon Musk bought the platform last year and sacked much of its staff. With ad revenue steadily declining, the social media company has been making several last-ditch attempts to revive the platform. The company, which is still losing money, is trying to come up with business models that are alternatives to advertising. The company’s Twitter Blue premium subscription, which costs $8 per month, has seen little uptake. This month Twitter began paying a share of ad revenue to some Twitter Blue subscribers, based on the amount of engagement with their tweets. That rewarded accounts that interact heavily with Musk himself. Musk’s remark on Twitter rebranding comes just days after he announced a new artificial intelligence company, xAI, which he claims will be to “understand the universe.” Musk recently announced the formation of xAI after accusing companies like OpenAI and Google of developing the technology without considering risks to humans.",

      "title": "Elon Musk’s X threatens nonprofit over Twitter disinformation and hate speech research",
      "text": "The social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, has threatened to sue independent researchers who documented a rise in hate speech and disinformation on the site since Elon Musk took it over last year. A lawyer for the billionaire sent a letter on 20 July accusing the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) of making “a series of troubling and baseless claims that appear calculated to harm Twitter generally, and its digital advertising business specifically”. Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, argued that the research on the platform’s failure to monitor hate speech posted by Twitter Blue subscribers was misleading. Screenshots of the letter were uploaded to the CCDH website. Two days before Spiro sent the letter, Musk had tweeted that the nonprofit organisation pushed censorship, calling it “truly evil”. A lawyer for the CCDH responded on Monday that Musk’s threat was “ridiculous” and said it represented “a disturbing effort to intimidate those who have the courage to advocate against incitement, hate speech and harmful content online”. The CCDH has heavily criticised Twitter in a series of reports, saying the company has made millions from both anti-LGBTQ+ content and from bringing back banned accounts. Musk, a self-proclaimed free-speech advocate, has made big changes to the platform since his takeover last October. They include reducing content moderation, replacing the existing Twitter verification system with a paid subscription service, firing a majority of the staff, and most recently rebranding the platform as X. Online hate speech on the rise The CCDH researchers are not the only ones to document a sharp rise in hate speech on the platform following Musk’s acquisition of it. A computer scientist at the University of Southern California and his team also found that hate speech significantly increased on the platform after Musk acquired it. A study from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and CASM Technology also found that antisemitism had remained “higher than ever” on Twitter. “Elon Musk’s actions represent a brazen attempt to silence honest criticism and independent research, in the desperate hope that he can stem the tide of negative stories and rebuild his relationship with advertisers,” said Imran Ahmed, Chief Executive Officer of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, in a statement posted on the nonprofit's website. “Advertisers are fleeing his platform for one clear reason: Elon Musk has supported the proliferation of hate and racism on it, and he doesn’t care to stop it. In a statement , X said that it rejected the claims made by CCDH and accused the organisation of “actively working to prevent free expression”. This is not the first time that Musk has fired back at his critics. Last year, he suspended the accounts of some prominent journalists who reported on his takeover and also suspended a user for using publicly available data to track his private plane.",

      "title": "Indonesia still keen to court Elon Musk, ‘not worried’ by Tesla’s Malaysia base",
      "text": "As Indonesia continues its years-long effort to woo investments from billionaire Elon Musk, observers have said the country’s giant nickel reserves may not be as large a draw as hoped, while its fossil fuel reliance suggests Jakarta is “not entirely serious” about its renewable energy push. Luhut Pandjaitan, Indonesia’s coordinating minister of maritime affairs and investment, said last month that he planned to speak with the world’s richest man during a visit to California on August 2, in an umpteenth attempt to strike a deal as the country seeks to become a regional electric-vehicle manufacturing hub. While Jakarta did not confirm if Luhut eventually met Musk, Health Minister Budi Sadikin did score a meeting on August 4 with the entrepreneur to discuss cooperation with his satellite network, Starlink, to provide low-cost internet access to remote health centres in the archipelago. “With internet access, health service consultations can be done online,” Budi said on Sunday. Jakarta’s dogged charm offensive comes even as it has been left humbled by the businessman’s decision to house Tesla’s Southeast Asian headquarters in neighbouring Malaysia, where it launched operations on July 20 with the release of its Model Y and Model 3 cars, priced from 199,000 ringgit (US$43,600) to 288,000 ringgit. Many Indonesian publications took a dim view of the development, saying Jakarta had been “snubbed”, while The Jakarta Post said Indonesia’s window to become a major EV manufacturer was closing. “Jetting across the world to convince would-be investors is a noble effort, but something may be lacking in Indonesia’s offer. We have the biggest economy in Southeast Asia, a growing consumer market, EV purchasing incentives and the world’s largest nickel reserves,” the newspaper said in an editorial on August 3. “Should global players not be scrambling to invest here?” Malaysia’s already won over Tesla and Amazon. Will Google, Microsoft be next? Officials from Luhut’s ministry have spent the past week reassuring the public that Tesla’s new regional headquarters in Selangor was not a sign that Indonesia was being overlooked by Musk. “Tesla’s investment in Malaysia is not [in the form of] an EV factory, but for sales and distribution, so we’re not too worried about that,” Septian Hario Seto, deputy for investment and mining coordination at the ministry, said on July 25. “What we are targeting are EV factories. For Malaysia, it only invests in distribution and charging networks.” Indonesian officials have also made a few unsubstantiated claims to prove their efforts were not fruitless. Last August, Luhut claimed Tesla had agreed to purchase US$5 billion worth of Indonesian nickel produced by China’s Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt and CNGR Advanced Material. Tesla has never commented on this claim. In February, Widodo said in an interview with Reuters that he was “confident” Tesla would invest, as the country had the world’s biggest nickel reserves at 21 million metric tonnes. Nickel is a key material in EV batteries. “I said to [Musk] that if you invest in Indonesia, I will give concessions in nickel [mining],” Widodo had said. Tesla has not made any decisions to date. Tesla doesn’t use nickel-based batteries any more, so it will be difficult for Indonesia to get Tesla to set up an EV battery facility here Andry Satrio Nugroho, Institute for Development of Economics and Finance Andry Satrio Nugroho, a researcher of industry, trade and investment at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance in Jakarta, said nickel was not likely to be an attraction for Tesla. “Tesla doesn’t use nickel-based batteries any more, so it will be difficult for Indonesia to get Tesla to set up an EV battery facility here,” he said. “One of the things that made Musk switch to [lithium iron phosphate] batteries was Indonesia’s ban of nickel ore export, which made nickel prices go up.” LFP batteries do not contain nickel or cobalt, and are easier and cheaper to make, although they pack less energy density than nickel-based batteries. ‘We shouldn’t be gutless’: Indonesia doubles down on bauxite ore export ban Nugroho said, however, that competition with Malaysia was not a zero-sum game. There was still room for Musk’s investments in Indonesia, namely for his aerospace company SpaceX and its subsidiary Starlink, which provides high-speed satellite internet to remote areas, he said. “Indonesia already uses SpaceX services to launch its satellites. Jokowi also eventually needs to say that the country needs Starlink for the remote regions; it will be a win-win solution for Indonesia and Starlink,” he said, referring to Widodo’s popular nickname. ‘Not serious’? Apart from selling cars, Tesla is establishing a head office, service hub and experience centre in Malaysia’s Selangor, and will invest “significantly” in a network of fast-charging and regular-charging stations across the country. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Musk was also interested in rolling out his Starlink satellite service across the country. He said “political stability” had brought Tesla to the nation of 33.9 million people. “When the unity government came about, there is political stability … When the political climate is stable, people are sure to come,” he said during a speech on July 28. Will Malaysia put energy exports to Singapore before its green economy plans? According to Anwar, it was Musk who had contacted him for a meeting, after a previous request made by a former minister failed. “Elon Musk is the richest person in the world. Elon Musk is richer than countries. It is quite difficult to bring him in. But once we became stable, I didn’t ask to talk to him; he asked to talk to me,” he said. But analysts note that political stability is not the sole driver for Tesla’s investments in the region. Before Malaysia’s election last November, the country had three prime ministers in three years, and a unity government consisting of Anwar’s party and former foes was forged to calm divisions in the country. In comparison, Widodo has governed Indonesia since 2014, with his coalition making up more than 81 per cent of seats in parliament. Indonesia, however, fares poorly in environmental social governance (ESG) aspects, a set of standards used by a company to screen potential investments, Nugroho of Indef said. “There are still many issues that Indonesia has not complied with enough, especially the ESG aspects of its nickel mining sector. From there, maybe Tesla withdrew its intention to build [a manufacturing facility] here,” Nugroho said. There have been reports in recent years detailing the harsh conditions faced by workers in Indonesia’s nickel-mining hub of Sulawesi, where many Chinese firms have set up shop, as well as the environmental damage caused by the operations of smelters, which are reliant on fossil fuels. Daymas Arangga, executive director at Jakarta-based Energy Watch, said Jakarta was “not entirely focused and serious” in transitioning to renewable energy, as fossil fuels still accounted for 60 per cent of Indonesia’s energy supply. The lack of green energy may have reduced investor appetite, especially EV producers, to set up shop domestically, he said.",

      "text": "Rumours persist about Colosseum as potential fight venue. Elon Musk on Friday confirmed media reports that he is to fight Mark Zuckerberg at an \"epic location\" in Italy, following months of rumours. Musk, who owns Twitter (recently rebranded as X), said the cage fight with Facebook (Meta) founder Zuckerberg would be managed by their respective foundations, not by the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He said the highly-anticipated fight would be livestreamed on Meta and X, writing: \"Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome, so nothing modern at all.\" Musk, 52, claims that he has spoken to Italian premier Giorgia Meloni and culture minister Gennaro Sangiuliano about the fight, adding that they \"have agreed on an epic location\" and that all proceeds will \"go to veterans\".

White predicted the event would bring in \"a billion dollars in revenue\" and claimed it was the kind of fight that even \"your grandmother would watch\". In late June TMZ reported that an Italian culture ministry official contacted Zuckerberg, 39, about staging the MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) clash with Musk at \"the most fabled fight theater in history.\" Musk then posted a series of tweets referencing the Roman amphitheatre, including: \"Some chance fight happens in Colosseum\" and a quotation from the movie Gladiator: \"What we do in life, echoes in eternity\". Italian culture ministry denies reports of Musk vs Zuckerberg fight in Colosseum At the time, a culture ministry spokesperson said that the proposal to host a fight between the two tech billionaires was \"unfounded\", in a statement published by Corriere della Sera newspaper. Noting that use of the Colosseum is granted to a select number of high-profile paid events \"almost always for charity\", the ministry said that if Zuckerberg and Musk wished to \"perform in the Colosseum\" it should be \"a non-violent challenge\", proposing \"a sort of certamen, a duel with Latin verses.\"",

      "text": "The much-hyped cage match between tech rivals Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk appears to be on ice. Zuckerberg, Meta’s CEO, said Sunday he believes Musk, owner of X, formerly Twitter, isn’t serious about facing him in a mixed martial arts fight and should let it go nearly two months after trash talk surrounding the possible showdown began. “I think we can all agree Elon isn’t serious and it’s time to move on,” the Facebook founder wrote on his new platform Threads Sunday. He said he offered a real date for the billionaire battle and Dana White, UFC president, was willing to make the fight a “legit competition” with the proceeds going to charity. “Elon won’t confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead,” Zuckerberg wrote. “If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me.” In return, Musk called Zuckerberg a “chicken” on X in reply to a tweet about the brouhaha. Zuckerberg, 39, has previously complained that he was ready to face his tech rival, but Musk, 52, wouldn’t commit to firm details. Before Zuckerberg’s latest shot at his social media competitor, Musk shared a purported text exchange between him and Zuckerberg. The texts allegedly showed Zuckerberg telling Musk he should train on his own and to let him know when he’s ready to brawl. Zuckerberg, who trains in jujitsu, apparently said he didn’t want to keep hyping something that would never happen and advised Musk to either commit to the cage match or forget about it. Musk texted back that he hasn’t been practicing much, but inquired about a practice fight in Zuckerberg’s backyard octagon. Musk, who also leads Tesla and SpaceX, first challenged Musk to a “cage match” in June, which Zuckerberg was quick to accept. The X owner previously said the fight would be live-streamed on his platform and on Meta with the money raised from the fight going to charity. He teased it would take place in an “epic location” in Italy. But he also recently revealed that he has a shoulder problem that may require surgery with a recovery period of “a few months.”",

      "title": "Contradiction Paradox: Elon Musk’s Advocacy for AI Restraints, Amid Warp Speed Acceleration",
      "text": "As we engage in the conversation, we explore Elon Musk’s perspective on the necessity of global AI deceleration and the establishment of regulations and enforcement policies. However, a subtle doubt emerges regarding the authenticity of his intentions. Despite his well-meaning motives and eloquent expressions, a pertinent question surfaces: Is it possible to genuinely regard his stance, considering the divergence between his actions and the principles he puts forth? Elon Musk’s track record presents a paradox. Let’s zoom in on the details to examine this apparent contradiction. One key aspect to consider is Tesla, a company often perceived not only as an automobile manufacturer but also as one of the most advanced AI entities globally. Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features showcase a significant investment in AI technology, pushing the boundaries of autonomous driving capabilities. Furthermore, Musk’s involvement in creating the new “chip dojo,” an advanced microcomputing facility, raises eyebrows. This facility appears to be at odds with slowing down AI development, as it implies a dedicated effort to enhance AI capabilities through more powerful hardware. The project aims to achieve a computing capability of 100 exaflops calculations per second) by 2024. One exaflop is the equivalent of a quintillion calculations per second. Another significant point is Musk’s co-creation of OpenAI. This organization has produced some of the most advanced learning models, including those based on the GPT series, contributing to rapid AI advancement rather than a slowdown. Musk’s involvement in X AI, often called AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), signifies his ambition to push AI to the next level. AGI represents a potential step towards human-level intelligence in machines, a direction that seemingly contradicts the call for restraint. Neuralink, another venture of Musk’s, seeks to link the human brain with artificial intelligence directly. This synergy between the human mind and AI technology contradicts the notion of regulating AI’s growth and maintaining a certain distance. Lastly, the creation of sentient robots raises concerns. These robots, designed to have a human-like consciousness, seem to align with the very technological development that Musk is cautioning against. All these actions and projects collectively paint a picture of Musk advocating AI’s slowdown and actively contributing to its rapid progress. This raises valid questions about his genuine intentions. Despite vocalizing concerns about the role of AI, his actions seem to propel the technology forward at an accelerated pace. The call prompts us to critically assess Elon Musk’s sincerity in advocating for a slowdown in AI development. While his words convey a desire for caution and regulation, his actions tell a different story—a story of ambitious ventures, advanced AI initiatives, and a trajectory that contradicts his stated intentions. This intricate interplay between Musk’s words and deeds leaves us wondering whether his concerns are genuine or whether his ultimate goals lie elsewhere.",

      "title": "Elon Musk takes heat after announcing apparent end of 'block' feature on X: ‘Worst idea ever’",
      "text": "Prominent social media users voiced strong disapproval towards X owner Elon Musk after he announced the company was working on removing the \"block\" feature for the site formerly known as Twitter. Longtime users of the platform complained that the \"block\" function, which allows accounts to prevent themselves from seeing and interacting with specific accounts and keeps those accounts from engaging with them, is a crucial element of X. Several noted that it was the only real way to not see content they do not want to see. The function is often employed by users to stop trolls who repeatedly spam or criticize them. LARRY ELDER FEUDS WITH CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD OVER BIDEN'S 'YOU AIN'T BLACK' LINE: 'SHOULD'VE BEEN WAKE-UP CALL' Musk made the controversial announcement over X on Friday, in response to an account questioning the utility of the feature. The account \"Tesla Owners Silicon Valley\" posted Friday, \"Is there ever a reason to block vs mute someone? Give your reasons.\" The \"mute\" function is another option on X that allows viewers to simply screen posts from certain users from their feeds, but allows the muted account to continue seeing the muter's content. An account that's been muted by an individual user does not know it's been muted, whereas it is notified it's been blocked if it tries to view the blocker's account. Musk replied to the account’s post directly, posting, \"Block is going to be deleted as a ‘feature’, except for DMs.\" Musk seemed to be alluding to a way that users could \"block\" certain users from messaging them directly on the app. The billionaire tech guru added that the block function \"makes no sense.\" However, disgruntled users flooded Musk’s reply, insisting that \"block\" is an important feature that needs to stay. Conservative commentator Buck Sexton disagreed with Musk’s proposal, posting, \"Blocking is one of the most important features on this site. Otherwise, it just turns into an echo chamber of harassment from the most vile idiots.\" WATCH: CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST BLOODIED AND BRUISED AT PRO-TRANS RALLY IN CANADA: ‘POLICE DID NOTHING’ Conservative activist Billboard Chris slammed Musk’s call as well, writing, \"Worst idea ever. Those who talk about controversial subjects will be flooded with trolls whose sole intent is to start fights and spread false info. My replies should not be a platform for haters and liars, never mind the ones who will dox.\" He had another critique for Musk’s platform, adding, \"Considering the reporting process through X is still dreadful, this is the least intelligent move you’ve made.\" Countering the point made that muting does the same job as blocking in effect, the activist added, \"All muting does is stop me from seeing people’s posts. They’re free to reply.\" The \"Wall Street Silver\" account slammed Musk’s idea, posting, \"This is a huge mistake. Block is a critical feature on this app. Regretted minutes would skyrocket. There are certain evil people that users just don't want following them or replying to them. Scammers, cyber stalkers, etc.\" He theorized, \"I suspect many people would abandon X if they can't block the harassing accounts out of their lives.\" Liberal journalist David Leavitt trashed the idea as well, posting, \"Imagine not being able to understand why you’d want to block someone @elonmusk is actively destroying this site bit by bit.\" MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan, an outspoken critic of Musk, accused him of making yet another poor decision with his social media site. He wrote, \"Bring back the Nazis. Let them get verified. Put ads next to them. And get rid of the Block feature. What could possibly go wrong?\" Conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair stated, \"If the block feature is to be removed, there needs to be zero anonymity on X anymore. But it’s my understanding Elon sees the value in anon accounts. If we can’t block those stalking, harassing, and threatening, then remove anonymity so recourse can be sought through the law.\" Prominent anti-Trump user David Weissman condemned the move for similar reasons, writing, \"I block antisemites, and a mentally ill obsessed stalker who’s doxxed me, harasses me, and exploits my children. Yet Elon Musks thinks it’s ok to let these people back in your house.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For more Culture, Media, Education, Opinion and channel coverage, visit foxnews.com/media",

      "title": "Elon Musk seeks 'epic location' in Italy to fight Mark Zuckerberg -- but Colosseum ruled out",
      "text": "Get ready for the Fisticuffs in Florence or the Venom in Venice. Just not the Rumble in Rome. Elon Musk has reached out to Italy leader Georgia Meloni to secure an “epic location” for his “cage match” with tech rival Mark Zuckerberg — but a government official has ruled out the Eternal City as a venue. “I spoke to the PM of Italy and Minister of Culture,” Musk tweeted on Friday. “Livestream will be on this platform and Meta. Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome, so nothing modern at all.” Musk also posted a cryptic tweet hours later with a potential date for the clash between the tech titans. “Gaius Julius Caesar, March 15,” he posted on his rebranded Twitter site X, a reference to the infamous Ides of March when the emperor was killed. However, the much-rumored “Gladiator”-style showdown at the ancient Colosseum or the any other historic site in Rome will not be in the cards. Italian culture minister Gennaro Sangiuliano said, “It will not be held in Rome.” “I had a long and friendly phone conversation with Elon Musk,” he told The Guardian. “We talked about the common passion for the history of ancient Rome. We are discussing how to organize a great charity and, historical evocation event, in full respect of the sites.” The Post has sought comment from the ministry. After Musk tweeted earlier this month that he would be “up for a cage fight” with Zuckerberg, the Facebook co-founder shot back by posting a screenshot of Musk’s tweet with the caption “send me location.” Zuckerberg’s team reportedly passed on the message to Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White, whose people contacted Italian officials, according to TMZ Sports. However, the outlet later reported that sources with direct knowledge confirmed that the ministry first reached out to Zuckerberg privately, then the request was forwarded to White, and there was a follow-up and a call was set for next week. In response, Musk tweeted that there was “some change [the] fight happens in Colosseum,” which Sangiuliano has since quashed. Despite the setback, Musk still seems to have his eyes on Italy, firing out a series of tweets in Italian, including one that says “dulce est desipere in loco,” which translates to “it is sweet to be lost in the place.” Representatives for Musk and Zuckerberg did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. Though both tech moguls have been training with Lex Fridman — artificial intelligence researcher at MIT who hosts the “Lex Fridman Podcast” and also has a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu — Zuckerberg undoubtedly has more experience in the sport. While Musk has a significant size advantage compared to his tech rival, he may still have his work cut out for him against Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, 39, has been training in MMA gyms since September with the hopes of competing, he revealed on June 17. In a May, Zuckerberg revealed via an Instagram post that he won his first amateur Brazilian jujitsu tournament. Musk, 52, also recently revealed that he has a shoulder problem that may require surgery with a recovery period of “a few months.”",

      "title": "Elon Musk sells off even more Twitter collectibles as part of rebranding auction including famous...",
      "text": "Elon Musk is selling off more Twitter collectibles in a rebranding auction after he changed the company's name to X. Items including the famous blue bird logo, guitars, and an oil painting of Ellen DeGeneres' selfie on the night of the 2014 Oscars will be available, with bids starting at $25. Musk, 52, officially rebranded the social media from Twitter to X on July 24, in the latest controversial shake up of the social media company under his ownership. Founded in 2006, Twitter takes its name from the sound of birds chattering, and it has used avian branding since its early days, when the company bought a stock symbol of a light blue bird for $15, according to the design website Creative Bloq. However, Musk has implemented sweeping changes since purchasing the brand outright in October 2022. The entrepreneur - who also owns Tesla and SpaceX - opted to switch Twitter's blue bird icon for a more minimalist design, simply altering it to a white 'X' on a black background. The alterations have proved unpopular with users, most notably his decision to remove 'legacy' blue ticks and force users to pay a fee in order to appear as a verified user on the platform. 'Legacy' blue ticks were initially given to verified accounts belonging to people of public interest including celebrities, politicians and journalists. Elon Musk has come in for heavy criticism after he opted to ditch Twitter's iconic blue bird icon, as part of his move to rebrand the platform to X The items - all of which will be able to be bid on for $25 - include an oil painting of Ellen DeGeneres' selfie on the night of the 2014 Oscars. The pictured included DeGeneres alongside fellow stars Bradley Cooper, Meryl Streep and Lupita Nyong’o Another oil painting on sale features the photo tweeted by Barack Obama, which went viral after he won another term as US president in 2012. The photo shows him hugging his wife, Michelle, and it became the platform’s most retweeted photo ever at the time Also featured is a portrait of the late actor Robin Williams, along with the powerful quote 'No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world'. The Californian company is trying to shift 739 lots featuring items that range from signs with the old Twitter bird logo to desks, chairs, coffee machines and musical instruments A number of musical instruments, including acoustic guitars and a drum kit, will be available. Musk, 52, officially rebranded the social media from Twitter to X on July 24, in the latest controversial shake up of the social media company under his ownership Musk, who also owns Tesla and SpaceX, opted to switch Twitter's name to 'X', as part of his efforts to rid of the so-called 'lords & peasants system for who has or doesn't have a blue checkmark' This decision came as part of Musk's efforts to rid of the so-called 'lords & peasants system for who has or doesn't have a blue checkmark'. Now, the Californian company is trying to shift 739 lots featuring items that range from signs with the old Twitter bird logo to desks, chairs, coffee machines and musical instruments. Other highlights include the actual Twitter logo on the front of the San Francisco headquarters and quirky portraits of Robin Williams, and an oil painting of Ellen DeGeneres' 2014 Oscars night selfie. A wooden hashtag decorated with plants can also be bid on at the auction. Hashtags have been synonymous with Twitter for a number of years, as they are often implemented by users to connect posts to a particular trend Founded in 2006, Twitter takes its name from the sound of birds chattering, and it has used avian branding since its early days, when the company bought a stock symbol of a light blue bird for $15, according to the design website Creative Bloq. A colourfully decorated piece of bird art, as well as keyboards, fridges, lockers are also among the items available as part of the auction, which is titled 'Twitter Rebranding: Online Auction Featuring Memorabilia, Art, Office Assets & More!' A second oil painting is also being shown, representing one of Twitter's most memorable moments. It features the photo tweeted by Barack Obama, which went viral after he won another term as US president in 2012. The photo shows him hugging his wife, Michelle, and it became the platform’s most retweeted photo ever at the time. One of the larger items offered is a repurposed barn from Montana, reconstructed to create a seating area dubbed 'The Lodge'. Keyboards, fridges, lockers and bird art are also among the items available as part of the auction, which is titled 'Twitter Rebranding: Online Auction Featuring Memorabilia, Art, Office Assets & More!' Among the more unusual items being sold are a coffee machine and a bird cage, the latter potentially referencing Twitter's previous name that is no longer present after Musk's takeover of the social media platform The latest auction comes after Musk held an unprecedented auction for more than 600 items - including furniture and items from the San Francisco headquarters - earlier this year Musk's efforts to raise funds for the company have also seen him auction a set of office chairs and a table.

      "title": "Elon Musk tells James Woods 'delete your account' after actor threatens to leave X over block button",
      "text": "Elon Musk’s pledge to remove the “block” option from X ticked off longtime supporter James Woods, who threatened to quit the site — prompting the tech mogul to say: “Then delete your account.” The Oscar-nominated actor, who has 3.4 million followers on the app formerly known as Twitter, panned “greedy capitalist” Musk’s vow to do away with the block button over the weekend, saying that doing so will make the site “untenable” for public figures such as himself. “In the midst of a libel suit I was targeted by thirty trolls the defendant enlisted to harass me,” Woods wrote in an X post on Saturday. “X will be untenable for people like me, who are willing to share their identities,” the two-time Oscar-nominated actor wrote. “If he does this, I will have no choice but to retire from this site.” A supporter of Woods responded to the post, writing that “we got to make sure that doesn’t happen.” Woods then elaborated, writing: “If Elon Musk removes the ability to block concerted harassment by trolls or organized political entities, how will ‘X’ be any different from Jack Dorsey’s horrid Twitter?” “Musk, whom I once championed, is only doing this to protect his advertisers anyway,” Woods continued. “Users of X are mere pawns to turn the site into an electronic shopping mall.” Woods wrote: “The man I thought was a defender of free speech is just another greedy capitalist.” “Disappointing, but not surprising.” Musk did not take too kindly to Woods’ critique, writing in response: “Then delete your account.” Several Musk supporters on X were alienated by the mogul’s announcement on Friday that he planned to do away with the block option. Musk on Friday said that enabling X users to block others “makes no sense” and that they should instead opt to “mute” anyone whose posts they shut off. “This is a huge mistake,” wrote the pro-Musk X account known as “Wall Street Silver.” “Block is a critical feature on this app,” the account user wrote. “Regretted minutes would skyrocket. There are certain evil people that users just don’t want following them or replying to them.” Musk taunted his critics on Sunday, writing on X that it was “pretty fun blocking people who complain that blocking is going away.” “How does the medicine taste?” Musk wrote. Musk may not be able to follow through with his plan, however. X users wrote a “community note” — which allows posters to offer clarifications and corrections on content that could be misleading — which states that doing away with the “block” feature could be a violation of the terms of service of Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store. “If the ability to block users was to be removed, X would be in violation of the policies of the App Store as well as the Google Play Store,” the note read. “Potentially, this could lead to X being removed from these platforms. There are no such policies for the web-app however.” The App Store’s guidelines state that any app must include “the ability to block abusive users from the service.” Google’s Play Store’s policy requires that apps offered through the service “provides an in-app system for blocking UGC (user-generated content) and users.” The Post has sought comment from Apple, Google, and X.",

      "text": "Twitter ’s rebrand as ‘X’ hasn’t quite gone to plan in Indonesia , where the site has been temporarily blocked because the domain was previously used by websites that posted “negative” content, Al Jazeera reported. Elon Musk announced on Sunday that the domain X.com, which he previously used for PayPal, had started redirecting users to Twitter. But according to Al Jazeera, millions of Indonesians were subsequently unable to access the social media platform due to the country’s strict rules that aim to curb online pornography and gambling. A screenshot shared by a Twitter user appears to show a page saying that the website had been blocked by Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Informatics for violating local laws and regulations. Atas perintah Elon Musk, Twitter resmi rebranding menjadi X (xdotcom). Jadi kalo kamu ketik url di web, kamu akan diarahkan ke Twitter. Tapi ternyata ga bisa di Indonesia. Hayoloh om Elon Musk, ada apa nih? pic.twitter.com/j1lji6Xnu8 — Eno Negatif Lari-Larian (@Eno_Bening) July 24, 2023 The ministry told Al Jazeera that the X.com domain had previously been used by websites that did not adhere to the country’s regulations against “negative” content. The ministry tends to block websites that are considered to be “offensive, criminal, or dangerous to social harmony,” Gatria Priyandita, a cyber policy analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Al Jazeera. This includes websites with adult content, Priyandita said, per the news outlet. Aribowo Sasmito, the co-founder of MAFINDO, a fact-checking group, told Al Jazeera that he believes the website was blocked because it sounded like “XXX,” a porn site. Xplained: Elon Musk gives his reason behind Twitter’s name change X.com began as an online bank founded by Musk in 1999, before it merged with Peter Thiel’s Confinity to become PayPal. The company was bought by eBay, which in 2014 used the domain for “x.commerce, an eBay Inc. company,” before Musk repurchased it in 2017, Insider’s Pete Syme reported. The director general of information and public communication at Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Informatics, Usman Kansong, told Al Jazeera that he has been in contact with Elon Musk’s company to try to get to grips with the situation. “Earlier today, we spoke with representatives from Twitter and they will send a letter to us to say that X.com will be used by Twitter,” Kansong said, per Al Jazeera. X did not immediately respond to Insider’s request for comment. Insider also reported on Monday that X.com was seemingly redirecting some users, including co-founder Jack Dorsey, to a GoDaddy ad.

      "title": "What is Elon Musk’s ‘everything app’ and what can it learn from China?",
      "text": "Elon Musk has indicated his desire to transform X, the microblogging site formerly known as Twitter, into an “everything app”.Musk’s plans appear to take inspiration from the Chinese super app WeChat.As Musk tries to take X to the next level, there are technical challenges to consider, too.For more stories, visit the Tech and Trends homepage. Musk’s plans appear to take inspiration from the Chinese super app WeChat. WeChat, which combines social media, digital payments, internet browsing and more into a single app, has become a ubiquitous part of daily life in China since its launch by tech giant Tencent in 2011. How did WeChat become a huge success? WeChat was successful in China for a variety of reasons, but key among them was the timing of the launch. In 2011, China only had 485 million internet users in a population of 1.3 billion people due to limited infrastructure and a large rural populous. The country also had limited credit card penetration, with many people relying heavily on cash. The highest denomination at the time was 100 renminbi, worth roughly $13. Enter WeChat and similar rival apps that allowed users to access payment services and other features on their mobile phones. Chinese users could suddenly “leapfrog” the era of desktop broadband straight into smartphones and apps, said Kendra Schaeffer, Head of Tech Policy Research at Trivium China. “[WeChat] filled a social economic contextual need. Simply picking that up and replicating it here isn’t necessarily going to work,” Schaeffer told Al Jazeera, referring to the chances of success for an “everything app” in the United States given the country’s very different internet landscape. The US internet ecosystem in 2023 is much larger and more fragmented than China’s in 2011. The market is also far more competitive. Musk’s super app will have to contend with the likes of TikTok, which wants to launch an e-commerce business in the US, and the ubiquity of Google Pay and Apple Pay after the COVID-19 pandemic. Schaeffer said Musk will need to find a way to integrate a payment platform into his super app – the “secret sauce for success” – if he wants his app to succeed. This would free up users from clicking on third-party links, but such integration has so far eluded US developers. Schaeffer said: How was the Chinese government instrumental to WeChat’s success? Super apps like WeChat have succeeded in part thanks to the support of the Chinese state – a powerful force that is difficult to match in a US or Western context. Beijing has banned foreign platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and endorsed local apps like WeChat that lend themselves well to social control and government censorship. Most Chinese government departments and local authorities operate WeChat accounts as a way to disseminate information – which recently included a call for citizens to join counter-espionage efforts and report suspicious activity. “Few things survived the fad of Chinese digital transformation, but super-apps like WeChat integrate well with the state’s ambition of organising all aspects of the citizen’s life for political control,” Kitsch Liao, an assistant director of the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, told Al Jazeera. What other challenges does Musk face? Musk’s ownership of the social media platform once known as Twitter has been tumultuous. After purchasing Twitter for $44bn last year, Musk fired more than three-quarters of the company’s employees and introduced changes to moderation that have been blamed for a rise in hate speech on the platform and an exodus of advertisers. The company’s subscription-based Twitter Blue service has struggled to attract subscribers, while the rebrand to X has been widely panned. Last month, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX admitted the company’s advertising revenue had plunged about 50 percent and cash flow was negative, despite earlier predictions the company would break even by this year. As Musk tries to take X to the next level, there are technical challenges to consider, too. Musk will need to figure out how a presumably US-based super app would work on the back end, said Liao, including handling issues such as currency choice, consumer data protection and privacy – especially if the app were to operate on a global scale like Twitter. US tech giants such as Meta and Google have already landed in hot water in the European Union over consumer data protection concerns and anticompetitive practices. It is unclear whether Musk’s “everything app” would only launch in the US or take on multiple regions at the same time. WeChat has limited use outside China and has the advantage of only having to answer to one government in Beijing. “It has not been made very clear amongst all these concerns that this is a promising or viable model for the more liberal and consumer-rights oriented Western markets,” Liao said.",

      "title": "Elon Musk says he 'may require surgery' ahead of Zuckerberg 'cage match'",
      "text": "Oh, my back! X owner Elon Musk warned that he “may require surgery” to fix an old sumo wrestling injury — putting his possible “cage match” with Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg on hold. Musk addressed his health status late Sunday, just hours after announcing that his grudge bout with the jiu jitsu-trained Zuckerberg would be live-streamed on the X platform and that “all proceeds will go to charity for veterans.” “Exact date is still in flux,” Musk wrote. “I’m getting an MRI of my neck & upper back tomorrow. May require surgery before the fight can happen. Will know this week.” When Musk revealed his live-streaming plans for the fight, Zuckerberg fired back by quipping that the pair should use a “more reliable platform that can actually raise money for charity.” Zuckerberg, an MMA fanatic who regularly trains and competes in the sport, wrote on Threads that he is “ready today” to challenge Musk. “I suggested Aug 26 when he first challenged, but he hasn’t confirmed. Not holding my breath,” Zuckerberg said. “I love this sport and will continue competing with people who train no matter what happens here,” he added. Musk, 52, has long claimed to have suffered the back injury while squaring off against a sumo wrestler, tweeting last year that he “managed to throw him, but it cost me smashing my c5-c6 disc & 8 years of mega back pain!” Musk also alluded to the possibility that his back issues would delay a Zuckerberg fight in a July post. “I might need an operation to strengthen the titanium plate holding my C5/C6 vertebrae together, but otherwise good to go,” Musk said at the time. Musk and Zuckerberg have teased an upcoming mixed martial arts bout for months while feuding over the latter’s decision to launch the text-based social media app Threads, which is attempting to snag users from X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. While Musk has a significant size advantage compared to his tech rival, he may still have his work cut out for him against Zuckerberg. The Facebook founder shocked the public while sharing a photo of his ripped physique alongside UFC champions Israel Adesanya and Alex Volkanovski. In May, Zuckerberg entered and won his first-ever amateur Brazilian jiu-jitsu tournament. Musk has also bragged about his own preparations for the fight, posing a photo with UFC legend Georges St. Pierre after a July sparring session and posting about lifting weights at work. “If the fight is short, I probably win,” Musk wrote on Sunday. “If long, he may win on endurance.

      "text": "NEW YORK — Elon Musk says he may need to get surgery before a proposed “cage match” with Mark Zuckerberg. The two tech billionaires seemingly agreed to an in-person face-off in late June. It’s unclear if a physical fight will actually end up happening, but Musk and Zuckerberg have continued to fuel interest in the potential match through online jabs at one another — most recently on Sunday, when Musk said the fight would be live-streamed on his social media site X, formerly known as Twitter. Musk added that the fight’s proceeds would go to a charity for veterans. On his Threads social media account, Zuckerberg responded: “Shouldn’t we use a more reliable platform that can actually raise money for charity?” In a follow-up post, the CEO of Facebook’s parent company Meta said he wasn’t “holding his breath” for a fight. “I’m ready today. I suggested Aug 26 when he first challenged, but he hasn’t confirmed,” wrote Zuckerberg, who is actually trained in mixed martial arts and posted about completing his first jiu-jitsu tournament earlier this year. “I love this sport and will continue competing with people who train no matter what happens here.” Earlier Sunday, Musk said was training for the fight by lifting weights. He later addressed the timing of the fight — noting the date “is still in flux” due to a scheduled MRI and the potential of surgery. “I’m getting an MRI of my neck & upper back tomorrow,” Musk wrote Sunday night. “May require surgery before the fight can happen. Will know this week.” Talk of an in-person fight all started in June, when Musk, who owns X, responded to a tweet about Meta preparing to release a new Twitter rival called Threads. He took a dig about the world becoming “exclusively under Zuck’s thumb with no other options” — but then one Twitter user jokingly warned Musk of Zuckerberg’s jiu-jitsu training. “I’m up for a cage match if he is lol,” Musk wrote. After Zuckerberg appeared to agree to the proposal, Musk proposed the Vegas Octagon. Whether or not Musk and Zuckerberg actually make it to the Las Vegas ring has yet to be seen — especially as Musk often tweets about action prematurely or without following through. But, even if their cage match agreement is all a joke, the banter gained attention. An endless chain of memes and posts to “choose your fighter” sprung up in response. The Associated Press reached out to Meta, X and Ultimate Fighting Championship, which owns the Octagon, for statements Monday morning.",

      "title": "Everything you need to know about the unhinged Musk v Zuckerberg fight",
      "text": "Celebrity boxing matches are (unfortunately) nothing new. Social media stars such as Jake Paul, KSI and FaZe Temperrr have turned the sport into bloated spectacles. However, in what is perhaps the final death knell in the entertainment-ification of, well, everything — tech overlords Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have confirmed they will go head to head in the ring. \"Zuck v Musk fight will be live-streamed on X,\" Musk tweeted on his newly named social media app X (RIP Twitter). \"All proceeds will go to charity for veterans.\" To which the Meta CEO Zuckerberg clapped back that they should “use a more reliable platform that can actually raise money for charity.” Murmurs of the match first started as Zuckerberg announced he was launching a rival text-based platform Threads earlier this year. “I’m sure Earth can’t wait to be exclusively under Zuck’s thumb with no other options,\" Musk tweeted on June 20, seemingly digging at his fellow billionaire’s increasing data harvesting grab. As X users jokingly warned the Tesla boss that Zuckerberg was trained in jiu-jitsu, Musk responded, \"I’m up for a cage match if he is lol.\" Of course, sparring on social media is dystopian enough. But it seemed that neither knew when to stop. Zuckerberg agreed to the fight by replying: “Send me the location” while telling his Meta employees that he was doubtful that the fight would actually take place, according to insider sources. Either way, the 16th richest man in the world (Zuckerberg) proceeded to propose a date, August 26, while the richest man in the world (Musk) proposed a location, Vegas Octagon. The internet immediately started meme-ing it “Thrilla In The Meta”, with Musk bragging about his signature move: “I have this great move that I call ‘The Walrus’, where I just lie on top of my opponent & do nothing,” before later admitting that, “I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air.” As for Zuckerberg, he won gold and silver medals in his first jiu-jitsu tournament last month. Still, the two social media titans have failed to lock in a date, especially as Musk revealed he may need surgery before the cage fight. “I’m getting an MRI of my neck & upper back tomorrow,” Musk wrote on X. “May require surgery before the fight can happen. Will know this week.” Although Zuckerberg has continued to tease Musk, tweeting yesterday that he is \"not holding his breath\" over the proposed bout, in a new interview with Wired Grimes, the mother of two of Musk’s children, said she believes it will go ahead, adding: “Elon is very strong, but [Zuckerberg] seems like he’s been training a ton.” “I would prefer that it didn’t happen,” she added. “I love gladiatorial matches, but watching the father of your children in a physical fight is not the most pleasant feeling. But it’s not going to cause brain damage, so actually I think this is good.” Considering social media is largely behind the rise in desperate virality stunts being performed by, well, everyone — it was only this week former Health Secretary Matt Hancock lip synced to “I’m Just Ken” on TikTok — perhaps it’s not so strange that the two most influential social media bosses are going head to head. All in all though it feels a bit like the Ken fight scene in Barbie — you know, the one where they all break into a song and dance as they peacock one another. Even Grimes agrees. “Dudes need some outlet for trad masculinity. I told Sam Altman [CEO of OpenAI] there should be a follow-up, him against Demis [Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind].” While Musk described the clash as \"a civilised form of war\" — adding that \"men love war\" when asked what the point of the fight was. I can hear Greta Gerwig rolling her eyes from here.",

      "text": "Nothing says romance quite like gatekeeping. Author Walter Isaacson — working on an upcoming biography about Elon Musk — posted an excerpt of the book to X, formerly Twitter, Monday. The excerpt he shared outlines Musk’s courtship with Grimes, and to some, the Tesla CEO’s flirting style may seem a bit off the beaten path. According to the excerpt, the “Oblivion” singer compared Musk to J.R.R. Tolkien’s fictional wizard Gandalf on their second date. Her reference immediately resulted in Musk giving her a “rapid-fire trivia test on ‘Lord of the Rings.’” “He wanted to see whether she was truly a faithful fan. She passed,” Isaacson wrote. “That mattered to me,” Musk told Isaacson of Grimes passing his little pop quiz. This, however, wasn’t the most obnoxious thing Musk did to woo Grimes on their second date. While driving to a restaurant, Musk decided to peacock a bit by flaunting his Tesla. “He showed how fast the car accelerated, then took his hands off the wheel, covered his eyes, and let her experience Autopilot,” Isaacson writes. “I was like, ‘Oh shit, this guy is fucking crazy,’” Grimes told Isaacson. But apparently, his stunt impressed the musician — although Tesla’s Model Y owner’s manual advises that drivers do not operate the vehicle this way, per People. “The car was signaling and changing lanes by itself,” Grimes told Isaacson. “It felt like a scene out of a Marvel movie.” The excerpt also describes the former couple’s first date, which consisted of Musk inviting Grimes to visit the Tesla factory in Fremont, California — Musk’s “idea of a good date,” Isaacson wrote. “We just walked the floor all night, and I watched him try to fix things,” Grimes told Isaacson. Although her inclusion of the word “try” is an amusing bit of shade, it seems that Musk’s tactics worked — and during their courtship, Grimes gifted Musk with “a box of animal bones she had collected,” according to Isaacson. The pair split in 2021 after three years of dating. They had two children together — a son named X Æ A-12 in 2020 and a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl in 2021. Here’s to hoping Musk doesn’t pull any of these stunts on his kids when they get older.",

      "title": "Opinion | ‘Oppenheimer’ and the Siren Song of World-Ending Technology",
      "text": "This transcript was created using speech recognition software. While it has been reviewed by human transcribers, it may contain errors. Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions. So we drove out to the Midwest for vacation. And so I was like, oh, we’ll just audiobook it. And between the drive back and forth, I barely had covered half of the book because it was like 27 hours or something ridiculous. Wait, you subjected your family to the “Oppenheimer” audiobook? They loved it. Or they lied to me. Either way. Well, I mean, I read it when it came out. It’s like 17 years ago, so I mean, I don’t remember. So once wasn’t enough. I just remember that it was great. Nerd. Uh-huh. So I had to read it again. Right, sure. Nerd! [MUSIC PLAYING] From New York Times Opinion, I’m Ross Douthat. I’m Michelle Cottle. I’m Carlos Lozada. And I’m Lydia Polgreen. And this is “Matter of Opinion.” So last week, Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” came out, and all four of us saw it. Not together. Not together, except in spirit, but so did a lot of other people. The movie has already made more than 80 million bucks at the box office. Now, if you haven’t seen it, I don’t know that anything we’ll discuss is the biggest spoiler, given that the movie is based on extremely famous historical events, but we probably shouldn’t promise not to have any spoilers, right? Spoiler, the good guys won World War II. Oh, well, that itself is a controversial statement, Carlos, but we’ll be talking about whether the movie is really about the good guys, what its moral vision is, what it says about when politics and potentially world ending science collide. But we’ll start with the basics. What did everybody think about the movie? Silence. Come on, come on. What did you — let’s hear it. I’m going to jump in. Fun family fair. I’m going to jump in. I thought the movie was spectacular. It’s obviously going to generate some controversy about whether they were too soft on communism or made Oppenheimer too much of a hero, but it was ambitious. It was, of course, gorgeous. There were some weirder moments in it that are kind of Christopher Nolan’s forte, but on the whole, it took what was a sweeping, huge book, “American Prometheus.” It won the Pulitzer. It is well worth a read and really gives it a good narrative that drives you through what is an unacceptable three hours. No movie should be three hours. But this one was good enough that I didn’t start to fidget like a four-year-old until about 2 and 1/2 hours in, which is always a good sign. Carlos, what did you think? I really enjoyed it. I wasn’t as troubled by the length because it sort of tells two stories. It tells the story of the race to design and test the atom bomb. And then it tells the story of how Oppenheimer was sort of cast aside by the very government that had deployed him for war-making purposes when he was no longer useful, when he became kind of an irritant. And I mean, those stories are woven together in the movie. So to me, since there was so much that was worth getting into, I wasn’t troubled by the length. I didn’t think it was too long at all. I love a biopic. I love an epic book. I love an epic movie. I mean, the performances, I thought, were incredible. And I have to say, I was astonished by the box office numbers that so many people wanted to see this movie because I think most people who go to the movies during summer blockbuster season aren’t necessarily looking to be challenged in this way. But yeah, I found myself quite swept up with it. Yeah, so the box office was remarkable. And since one of my big things is the decline and fall of the American movies and so on, I feel churlish saying anything negative about “Oppenheimer” because it is terrific that it did so well. And Nolan is terrific, and the cast was terrific. I wasn’t sure about the last hour of the movie. So it does this sort of — there’s sort of the central forward momentum narrative carrying you through the Manhattan Project, culminating in the big explosion, right, which comes about 2/3 of the way through the movie. And then there’s the aftermath in the 1950s, which takes two forms. You follow both Oppenheimer through the sort of closed, unfair kangaroo court hearing where he loses his security clearance over his various ties to the many communists who were associated with his social and intellectual world in the 1930 and ‘40s. And then you also get the failed nomination to Dwight Eisenhower’s cabinet of Lewis Strauss, played by Robert Downey, Jr., in a really terrific performance. Strauss was a Republican hawk, and Oppenheimer famously became a critic of arms race politics. But so the movie is sort of culminating in Lewis Strauss not getting the Secretary of Commerceship. And you can see what Nolan is doing here, but honestly, to me, there was just a pretty big gap between the drama of the literal atomic bomb and the drama of Lewis Strauss’s cabinet nomination. And in the end, I felt like that was an artistic failure. I totally get your point, but in a blockbuster movie, you have to have a villain. And who are we going to make the villain in a movie like this? It’s a very complicated, weird subject. And you had to have an antagonist for Oppenheimer. I actually disagree, and I think it’s actually a fascinating artistic choice because watching this movie, I thought, so much of it takes place in kind of the perfect setting for a film that is, in a lot of ways, about the professional managerial class. These dramas take place in these incredibly claustrophobic, bureaucratic, drab meeting rooms. And the only reason that you know that this is an incredibly important proceeding is that you have this assaultive score that’s coming at you with these incredible strings playing. And I think that there is this symmetry that feels very real to me. I guess it’s a metaphorical symmetry between the very real destruction of the atomic bomb and the very real power of personal grudges and spite between members of the professional managerial class over petty politics and power. So to me, that felt like a central tension and storyline of the entire movie. I agree that that’s a critical element of this story. And in some ways, just as dramatic as the race to develop the bomb, you can imagine the movie focusing on the Trinity test and then on Oppenheimer’s transformation, and sort of an activist against the H-bomb worrying about what he had unleashed. But the story is about how the government turns against him, how it found him dangerous. And something kind of remarkable is that I don’t know if you all saw the story, but just like last December of this past year, the Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm, finally nullified the commission’s revoking of Oppenheimer’s security clearance, saying that it had been, as more information came out about what the hearing had been like and the unfairness of the process, that they just couldn’t stand by it. I like the fact that the book and the movie really drive home how confusing a political time this was. So like well before the bomb or the hearings, you had this whole concern about, on the one hand, the Nazis, and this is the major race you’re fighting off. But even before Oppenheimer was drafted for this project, just like so much churn about communism. And so you had these two competing tensions, and he almost didn’t wind up in charge of the project because of his relationships. I think people forget what just kind of a weird global time that was. And this does a really good job of just trying to drive home how much cloud there was around everything. Yeah, well, I mean, it feels weird to say this with a three-hour movie, but you’re struck by all the things that they kind of had to leave out. You see how, in the movie, he’s this kind of immediately charismatic professor at Berkeley, right? It starts with one student, and then suddenly it’s packed because he’s so captivating. He was actually a terrible teacher initially. He was unintelligible. He taught himself slowly to become a better teacher. And that cult of Oppie kind of grew up around him. What Michelle mentions about the ferment of the moment is sort of even more alive in the book, even around physics. The movie kind of glosses over this because you don’t want to spend too much time on it, besides like, oh, look at all these cool formulas on a chalkboard, you know? But his genius was in helping others crystallize the ideas that they would pursue. And there’s a moment in the movie when I think the Matt Damon character, Groves, asks him, why he hasn’t won a Nobel Prize yet? Because everyone around him had Nobel’s. It’s super stressful when you’re like the one guy with no Nobel. Tell me about it. And it’s that the Nobel’s were awarded for super specific, deep contributions to a particular field. And Oppenheimer was kind of interested in everything. He was too distracted for that. He was a great enabler and crystallizer of other people’s ideas. I think one of the interesting things about that particular moment in physics and science, right, is that prior to World War II, prior to the Manhattan Project, there was still a way in which science was operating outside of what we now think of as kind of the American university model. It was much more European. There’s a really strong aristocratic vibe. And Oppenheimer himself is much — he’s rich, right? He’s a rich kid. I’m not sure this is completely, completely conveyed in the movie, though it’s clear that he’s vacationing in New Mexico. Yeah, he basically puts the Manhattan Project where he likes to go for vacation, right? It would be like, if you were like, well, I really like this little town on the coast of Maine. Let’s build the atomic bomb there. And there are a couple local lobster fishermen, but they won’t object. I guess I wonder what, as the resident reactionary, I thought the movie up till the sort of final 30 minutes was actually quite effective in making a case that maybe Oppenheimer, once the project was over, shouldn’t have a security clearance. I mean, I think the movie does a good job of portraying Oppenheimer as a very complicated, fairly unstable figure, someone who literally poisoned the apple of his professor while in graduate school, someone who was friends with tons of communists, ran a program that was successfully infiltrated by communists, apparently only had sex with either communists or ex-communists. His brother was a communist, don’t forget. His brother is a communist. The question is, should he have this security clearance? And the moment when Leslie Groves, played really well, as always, by Matt Damon, testifies and is asked based on the current Cold War era security guidelines, would Oppenheimer pass muster, and he has to say no, I mean, he’s right, isn’t he? Yeah. Although I thought the line was great because he said, no, but under the current system, I’m not sure I would have cleared any of these guys, which kind of gets to the period where scientists didn’t automatically going to think of themselves as extensions of the political argument. But it gets to the period where under the circumstances of a war against national socialism and imperial Japan, you have to say, yeah, if the best scientists are sort of compromised by associations with communism, it doesn’t matter. You have to have them in there. But then, once you’re in a Cold War environment with Soviet Russia, you probably wouldn’t run the Manhattan Project the same way. I think that’s right, but I think that there’s also, to your point, Ross, there’s a sort of a noblesse oblige around Oppenheimer. And that, I think, goes hand in hand with another big theme of the book and the movie, which is his kind of naivete. You see him floating in this world of ideas and theory and communism and the Spanish Civil War as a romantic cause. And all of those things are true. But they’re all taking place in an environment that’s outside of hard politics and more in the realm of the theoretical. And I think that what you’re seeing in the film is this, and actually in history, is this move towards a much harder and more concrete reality in which the people in this world actually have to deal with the consequences of theory. And it seemed that he saw losing his place in the establishment, the inner circle of decision making about what the future of the country should be, and how we should be dealing with these weapons, that it was a huge loss for him to lose his seat at the table inside. And he assigned basically zero value to the kind of moral mantle that he could and I think did pick up. It really gets at this kind of like professional managerial class and sort of noblesse oblige clashing. Yeah, there’s a piece from Vox on that last point by Haydn Belfield that’s called “Crybaby Scientist” that basically is just a — if you want to read the most anti-Oppenheimer take in this movie environment, that’s the place to go. And Belfield basically argues a version of what you just said, Lydia, that this was a guy who imagined himself as this core decision-maker, but who basically invented the bomb and gave it to the national security state and then was totally unable to manage or master the forces that he’d unleashed, while maintaining his desire to be seen as someone who was the insider sort of steering the ship. I think the piece is unfair to Oppenheimer in many ways, but it’s worth reading the strong anti-Oppenheimer take, which is also another question for you guys. There’s also been a lot of criticism of the movie from the left, arguing that it’s just too kind to Oppenheimer. It doesn’t spend enough time on the actual realities of what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, once again, Americans whitewashing their own evils via Hollywood. What do you guys think of that critique? My response to that is my response to a lot of these things, which is that not every movie or every piece is about everything. So this was about Oppenheimer. You can focus it on that. I mean, we can have another three-hour biopic on what about the fallout in New Mexico. I mean, there’s been talk about it has ignored what happened with the people who were downwind of the Trinity test. Yes, all of these are like questions, but again, not every movie is about every piece of a puzzle. It’d have to be longer than three hours, Michelle. And you already oppose that, so. No, I object on moral principle to movies that are that long. I think, first of all, it was a real choice not to portray or show anything from what actually happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which was utter and total and complete devastation. And when I finished the movie, I took the subway home and then immediately read John Hersey’s “Hiroshima,” which is an extraordinary book that really kind of gives you a sense of what took place there. And I think at the end of the day, I actually think that the way that the movie handled it was probably right. It would have felt, I think, somewhat gratuitous to go outside of the narrative of the movie and have newsreel footage or something that sort of gestured at the kind of destruction that this bomb actually wrought. And I felt that the moment where he’s speaking to a cheering, flag waving crowd, and they’re stomping their feet at Los Alamos, excited and celebrating that they’ve won the war by dropping this bomb on what was arguably a largely defeated enemy, he sort of has this kind of moment of conscience and what have you. So I think that was probably the right way to handle that. But the thing that was wild to me is there’s this moment where Oppenheimer says, sort of justifying the use of the bomb, that demonstrating the destruction of it will be so great that it’ll usher in the greatest peace that mankind has ever known. And in one regard, he was right in the sense that no one has ever deployed a nuclear weapon in a conflict situation since then. But in another way, we have not actually seen the greatest peace humankind has ever seen since then. So I don’t know. To me, that moment in the film really stuck with me. Yeah, there’s a moment when I think they’re showing images from the actual atomic bombings are being shown. And I think you see Oppenheimer looking away from it. Right? So in a way, the movie is giving his perspective and his sort of showing that for all his guilt and so on and sort of nightmares, there’s sort of the nightmare scene that you referenced, Lydia, of the jeering crowd with the sort of undertones of atomic destruction underneath it. For all that, Oppenheimer is also sort of maybe refusing to see, right? The movie doesn’t show you because Oppenheimer himself does not want to fully see what he did. The authors make a distinction between Oppenheimer taking responsibility, like yes, he made this thing, but not feeling guilt over it. And I felt that that was somewhat portrayed in the movie. What I liked, Ross, about that moment you mentioned when Oppenheimer looks away is that you see the colleagues around him, they’re all flinching. They’re watching. And it’s it’s painful for them. But he sees something and then immediately looks away. Well, and what’s also interesting is the justification, and I think actually, this has sort of become the conventional wisdom, was that even though Japan was on the verge of defeat, dropping the bomb saved lives, and you sort of see that in the amazing scene of Gary Oldman playing Harry Truman, sort of waving away the histrionic Oppenheimer saying he has blood on his hands. So yes, I mean, I think this notion that ultimately dropping the bomb saved lives has become the kind of conventional wisdom. And “Thank God for the Atomic Bomb,” which is a very influential essay by Paul Fussell in “The New Republic,” which was published in 1981, I think really sort of articulates that view. But I also think one of the things about the legacy of the atomic world in which we live that nobody really ever talks about is the Cold War had real consequences, and the fact that it couldn’t take place as a direct confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States meant that it pushed the conflict out into essentially the decolonized world, right? And the proxy wars of the Cold War, I mean, it’s, depending on how you do the math, somewhere between 10 and 25 million people died, depending on when you start counting and who you count. But wars in Vietnam, in Congo, in Ethiopia, which is my mother’s native land, Guatemala, all across Latin America. So it is interesting that there’s this kind of binary choice between the peace and never having a nuclear war, but boy, did it set off a huge number of proxy wars that just happened to have as its victims, not the people of the United States or Russia, but the people of largely the developing, poor, Black, Brown world. Yeah, and I don’t think you get a sense of that complexity from the end of the movie. My reading, at least, of the end of the movie is, is much more sort of binary, that it’s not that Oppenheimer created this sort of complex, new world where maybe direct superpower conflict becomes rarer, but proxy wars become more common. Instead, the movie ends with this vision of atmospheric destruction, fire spreading across all of the Earth, the true apocalypse that we’ve all lived in some kind of fear of ever since the 1940s. So in that sense, it’s presenting a vision of just sort of science slipping away from all political control and/or politics just doing what it will with terrifying technology. So let’s take a quick break here. And when we come back, we’re going to try and bring the conversation about the intersection of science and politics off the movie screen, out of the past, and into the present. So we’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back. So we’re going to talk now for a minute about not just what the story of Oppenheimer says about history and the early Cold War and the life of the man himself, but about our own future here, 80 years onward in the beginning of the 21st century, where the question hanging over lots of issues, nuclear biowarfare and biotechnology, now artificial intelligence, is, can human beings control and tame the technologies that we create that might have potentially world destroying consequences? So, for all of you watching a three-hour movie about the first time, arguably, the human race created such a technology, did it fill you with optimism about the human capacity to restrain itself once we’ve let certain genies out of the bottle? I don’t think we need to be feeling so optimistic. It’s not been around for that long. There’s still plenty of time for us to blow ourselves up, Ross. So there’s this one amazing moment in the book that I was hoping would appear in the movie, and that’s that when Oppenheimer dies, one of his three eulogists is George Kennan. So you have the father of the atom bomb being eulogized by the father of containment. And containment, of course, was the policy that, depending on how you interpret it, helped keep the two superpowers from going to war with one another with nuclear weapons. He has an amazing line in the eulogy. He says, on no one did there ever rest with greater cruelty the dilemmas evoked by the recent conquest by human beings of a power over nature out of all proportion to their moral strength. So it did not leave me with much optimism. There’s also this interesting development where Congress has looked at this movie and taken the opportunity to reintroduce some ideas about how to get their arms around it. I mean, we’ve seen Senator Ed Markey from Massachusetts hawking his proposal to ban AI from launching nuclear weapons. Now, I don’t think it’s going anywhere, but it’s got a very Dr. Strangelove doomsday machine feel to it. But it is what it is. Yeah, I mean, I think it’s so interesting because as I was watching the movie, I actually thought a little bit about — and don’t be mad at me. I thought a little bit about Elon Musk. [LAUGHS]: Lydia. He is not the kind of Sanskrit-reading sophisticate that Oppenheimer was. And he is also clearly of a different kind of political set of commitments, if you can even call them commitments, than Oppenheimer. But just looking at the various points of view that he’s taken, I think Musk shares this quality of bizarre naivete about the way that politics actually works. And I think like Oppenheimer, Elon Musk is a great synthesizer, perhaps not a great engineer of his own right. But there is this kind of protean quality that Elon Musk has. And in his naive replies to right-wing, even anti-Semitic and other people with those kinds of political views on Twitter, I do see kind of shades of a very crude version of Oppenheimer, which makes me feel like we’re in for a fair bit more of this kind of, quote unquote, “innovation” that is hurling forward without really thinking a great deal about it. I mean, Elon Musk has just announced that Twitter is going to become a company called X, which will be an everything company that is driven by AI and do banking and God knows what else. So hold on to your butts, guys. This is coming for us. But what’s interesting with Musk is that he is also a bit of an AI doomer, right, in the sense that he has been sort of supportive of some of the people calling for a pause in AI research. And a certain amount of Musk’s fascination with space travel rests on his professed fears about human extinction, the idea that we’re going to blow ourselves up in some way, shape, or form. Yeah, Musk is sort of skeptical. But in some ways, that’s the most dangerous, right? Because I think so was Oppenheimer, right? Like, there’s this quality of being both aware of and smart enough to know how destructive this thing could be, but also so smart and so curious and driven that you can’t help but want to push it as far as it can go. And it’s actually exactly in the hands of someone like Elon Musk, who professes to understand the dangers, but nonetheless hears the siren song of the future calling and of innovation and of science and of technology and sort of can’t resist following where it leads. Let me just play, I guess, devil’s advocate for a minute on the specific nuclear question, which I think is, it’s true, as Michelle said, that we’ve only had nuclear weapons for 80 years, 80 odd years, slightly less. And it is very hard for me to imagine a future in which they’re never used. There’s sort of a Chekhov’s gun quality to nukes in the world. At the same time, we do have multiple generations now of evidence that human beings, when given this awesome power, power to destroy whole countries, if not the whole world, do flinch from it, right? The idea that if you hand human beings an awesome, terrifying technology, they will just use it, has not been vindicated. So far, politics has actually worked to contain the use of nuclear weapons. The fear of AI is that it’s the fear of something that makes decisions that aren’t human anymore, that lead to destruction not through the sort of normal human power games and rivalries and so on that we’re all familiar with, but through some sort of alien computational logic, where it makes sense to fire all the nukes at once. And that, to me, feels like a difference between some of the fears we have now and the fears people had at the start of the nuclear age. Now it’s more like, well, we know what human nature is like, and we haven’t used the weapons, but we don’t know what AI is like. And maybe AI will use them. What do you guys think of that? I mean, there’s questions about loose nukes, dirty nukes. Obviously, the war in Ukraine, Putin is, I think, not a stable figure. But I do think the point that we have greater faith in the known frailty of human decision-making over the unknown power of AI decision-making and of rationality is a really important one. And I think that in some ways, it connects us back to the film in that science actually should be under the control of politics because in a moment where we’re all talking about we need to follow the science, follow the science, science is a method. It’s not an answer. It is a way of thinking about the world. And it needs to be balanced by other ways of thinking about the world. And those other ways include politics. They include religion. They include all kinds of ways that human beings organize their affairs and think about their values and things like that. So to me, it’s absolutely critical that AI stays as far away from these kinds of decisions as possible. Yeah, and I don’t think we have to limit this just to, say, AI and nuclear weapons. I mean, we did just come through a pandemic where there were serious questions about whether this came out of a scientific experimental lab that then takes its toll on the entire planet. I mean, and it’s just like people operate as though the unthinkable won’t happen until, of course, the unthinkable does happen. And even if what the COVID-19 pandemic wound up coming from wasn’t, in that case, a lab, which we may just never know, that doesn’t mean that the next one won’t. And we have all of these things going on scientifically that we just don’t have a good grasp on or as good a grasp as we should have. I think one thing that would be certainly more useful is if there is just an ongoing, vibrant conversation among all those arenas that Lydia mentioned — science, politics, ethics, religion. And to the extent that a movie like “Oppenheimer” and a book like “American Prometheus” cannot lionize scientists and say like, they’ve got the answers. If only we’d listened, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But rather, enable this more of a give and take among these fields, I think would be better off. Well, on that eloquent note, we’ll leave it there. And when we come back, we’ll be talking about the geopolitical metaphors hidden inside the “Barbie” movie. No, I’m kidding. When we come back, we’re going to get hot and cold. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back. And now it’s time for Hot, Cold, where one of us shares something that we’re into or over or somewhere on the thermometer in between. And Michelle, I think you have something for us. All right, it is perfection that Ross has mentioned “Barbie” because what I am hot on this week is the Barbenheimer phenomenon. Now, I’m not talking about the movies. I saw both of them. I enjoyed both of them. But what I enjoyed even more was the way that this phenomenon, which is for those who haven’t been paying attention, kind of the portmanteau sprung up on social media because these two wildly different blockbusters were opening the same weekend, a challenge sprung up for people to go see both movies. I love this because we’re at a period where going to the theater has become a rare event. And seeing movies as a shared experience is happening less and less and less. So for something like this to pop up just felt kind of delightfully communal. Movie theaters were hosting costume parties and encouraging people to come in their pork pie hats or their pink outfits. And you just had these groups of people, especially with the Barbie crew, including my friends and I, taking pictures of each other, complimenting each other’s outfits in the theater. It just had this feel, which was so unusual at this point in time. And it’s something that I think we need, especially after the last few years of isolation and grimness and pandemic horror, just for people to have a moment where they can come together, no matter how silly it is, and share this sort of thing. And celebrate the invention of the atomic bomb. Yes, that’s all — Hey, you can argue that Mattel and Barbie have been its own kind of destructive force as well. Well, that’s for a future episode. I was going to say that Mark Harris, the film writer, said something, I think, on Twitter about how often unexpected hits are more sort of shocking and disruptive in Hollywood than unexpected busts. And I think the hope right now for people who like the movies would be that Barbenheimer, combined with the disappointment surrounding many, many superhero sequels and Indiana Jones reboots and so on, will have some kind of substantial effect in what kind of movies get greenlit and made over the next couple of years, assuming, of course, that the writers’ strike ever ends, and that Hollywood ever gets back to making movies in the first place. This reminds me of a few years ago when Steve Martin was hosting the Academy Awards, and he started off saying, look, I don’t know if you all know this, but I’m really especially happy to host this year’s Academy Awards because all the proceeds from tonight’s event are going to massive corporations. So not to be a Barben whiner, but I don’t take such joy in kind of being manipulated effectively by this kind of massive marketing campaign surrounding these two movies. If you’re waiting for purity in your communal experience, you’re going to die lonely. This is America. I don’t think so. I think there are other ways to be communal beyond paying $35 for popcorn and a soda. I’m just saying, we’ve got to find a way to bring people back to communal events, rather than sitting in their basements watching Netflix all the time. Then I’m all for that. I agree, and I think I’ve really been bitten by the movie bug lately. I just recently signed up for a membership at Film Forum. I saw Jean-Luc Godard’s “Contempt,” a new print. There was a new print of “Midnight Cowboy.” So I’m all in on the return to the movies. And I don’t think any of those movies are putting money in the pockets of giant corporations that exist as we know them today. So I can feel really good about all of that. Until a Godard Cinematic Universe is launched. Launches, but I mean, I will say, one of the kind of leitmotifs of my summer has been just an absolute joy at the return to kind of communal experiences. We’ve seen real trouble in the world of theater, for example. I’m not talking about movie theaters. I’m talking about acting and actors on stage and things like that. And all of us need to vote with our feet and go and watch the theater, go to the movies, do things like this if we want these things — Thank you, Lydia. — to be part of our culture going forward. So I am with you, Michelle. I’ve got my bucket of popcorn, my giant gallon jug of Diet Coke, and Twizzlers. And I’m ready to go. So I guess I’ll see you at the movies. Fantastic. I’ll be wearing my hot pink disco jumpsuit. And on that note, as I clutch my Robert Oppenheimer action figure, that’s our show for the week. Bye, guys. See you next week.

      "title": "Twitter logo building sign among 500 things Musk auctioning off as rebrand progresses",
      "text": "The Twitter logo sign that used to hang on the company's headquarters building will be auctioned off, along with hundreds of other memorabilia. Twitter, now rebranded as X under owner Elon Musk's leadership, is organizing a large garage sale to clear out a total of 548 items, remnants of its past at the company's headquarters. Items available for auction include various office furniture, unique statues like \"#\" and \"@\" symbols, paintings including Ellen DeGeneres' iconic 2014 Oscar selfie and Barack Obama's reelection celebration, a bird cage with a Twitter logo bird, a reconstructed barn, musical instruments, and office equipment like desks, chairs, and refrigerators. It comes weeks after the Twitter logo sign was taken down from the building of the company's headquarters, and was replaced with a massive, flashing 'X' sign. However, that one was also taken down a few days later, and the reason why remains unclear. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US The auction, managed by Heritage Global Partners, is scheduled for September 12-13 in San Francisco, with a starting bid of $25 for the 584 items. This isn't the first time Twitter has auctioned off memorabilia, as a similar attempt was made in January. Mr Musk's changes to Twitter since his acquisition less than a year ago have included employee layoffs, a paywall, and reduced account authentication. Several companies had reduced their advertising spending on the platform due to concerns that Elon Musk's relaxation of content restrictions was enabling the spread of hateful and toxic speech. Linda Yaccarino, the new CEO of X, told CNBC in her first interview since she took over that she has been working extensively over the past eight weeks to rebuild relationships with major brands and advertisers on the platform. Ms Yaccarino's efforts reportedly have been focused on reaching out to prominent brands like Coca-Cola, Visa, and State Farm, engaging directly with their chief marketing officers and chief executives. Ms Yaccarino's aim has been to remind these brands of the platform's potential and the economic benefits of partnering once again. She said: \"I’ve lived on a lot of planes lately, direct conversations with CMOs and CEOs, and we cover a lot of ground and I focus on those that have either maybe paused or reduced spending to remind them about the power of the platform and the power of the user base and the economic potential of them partnering with us again.\" She mentioned that one of the challenges is that some big advertisers may not have been certain about who to communicate with, given the substantial reduction in staff from around 8,000 workers to 1,500 since Mr Musk's takeover. Ms Yaccarino said she has been assuring advertisers that tailored brand safety measures will ensure their ads are placed alongside appropriate content. She also indicated that the platform is attempting to strike a balance between Mr Musk's commitment to free speech and implementing techniques that make it harder for toxic posts to gain prominence among most users. “If it is lawful, but it’s awful, it’s extraordinarily difficult to see it,” Ms Yaccarino said. In her role under Elon Musk, Ms Yaccarino clarified that while Mr Musk focuses on product design and technological innovation, she oversees various aspects of the company, including partnerships, legal matters, sales, and finance. “Elon focuses on product design. He leads a team of extraordinary engineers and focuses on new technology,” she said. \"So think about it as Elon is working on accelerating the rebrand and working on the future. And I’m responsible for the rest. Running the company from partnerships to legal to sales to finance, all the things.” She emphasized her autonomy in this role and compared it to a relay race, with Mr Musk handing off ideas and innovations to her for execution and economic growth. Ms Yaccarino also spoke of her attention to Meta's Threads, a new competitor to Twitter. Despite a drop in user interest after an initial surge, she remains vigilant about competition and the need to continually adapt to evolving market trends.",

      "text": "Elon Musk reportedly gave Grimes a “trivia test” on Lord of the Rings when they first started dating. A forthcoming biography titled Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson – which will be released on 11 September – recounts the early days of the pair’s relationship when they first met in 2018. Canadian musician Grimes, real name Claire Elise Boucher, met the SpaceX founder, 52, first met in 2018 following a Twitter exchange, before making their red carpet debut as a couple at the Met Gala later that year. In an excerpt from the book shared by the author ahead of its official release, Musk is said to have invited Grimes to Fremont, California, to visit his Tesla factory for “his idea of a good date”. Grimes told the author of the date: “We just walked the floor all night, and I watched him try to fix things.” Then, according to Isaacson’s account, while driving Grimes to a restaurant the following night, Musk showed the singer how fast his car accelerated and then took his hands off the wheel, covered his eyes and let Autopilot control the car. “I was like, oh s***, this guy is f***ing crazy,” Grimes told Isaacson. “The car was signalling and changing lanes by itself. It felt like a scene out of a Marvel movie.” When they arrived at the restaurant, Grimes compared Musk’s powers to those of Gandalf, which prompted the Tesla CEO to give the “Oblivion” singer a trivia test on The Lord of the Rings. “He wanted to see whether she was truly a faithful fan. She passed,” wrote Isaacson. Then, as a “gift”, Grimes allegedly gave Musk a box of “animal bones she had collected”. In the evenings, Isaacson writes, the pair listened to Dan Carlin’s Hard Core History podcast and other historical audiobooks and podcast shows. “The only way I could be in a serious relationship is if the person I’m dating can also listen to an hour of, like, war history before bed,” Grimes told the biographer. Isaacson writes that while the pair were at the restaurant, Musk carved the pair’s initials “EM+CB” onto a wall. The pair welcomed their first child together in 2020 and named their son X Æ A-12. This year, they changed their son’s name to X AE A-XII to comply with Californian laws. In December 2021, they welcomed a second child via surrogate, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl. While the pair share two children, the pair are no longer together. They have been in an on-again, off-again relationship since they met, but Grimes said they broke up after the birth of their daughter. She described Musk as “my best friend and the love of my life”. Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson – author of bestselling biographies on Steve Jobs and Leonardo Da Vinci – is expected to be released on 11 September.",

      "title": "Musk leaks private messages with Zuckerberg on $1bn &#8216;super&#8217; fight ",
      "text": "The CEO of X (formerly Twitter), Elon Musk, Monday, leaked his private messages with his tech rival, Mark Zuckerberg persuading him to get serious over their proposed $1 billion super fight or move on. According to Daily Mail, Zuckerberg and Musk appeared set to battle it out when the latter tweeted that he was ‘up for a cage fight’ with his fellow billionaire, who responded by saying, ‘Send me location’. UFC president Dana White later confirmed that both men were indeed ‘serious’ about making an MMA showdown he is predicting would generate over $1bn in revenue happen at some stage this year. White also revealed last week that he had been in talks with the Italian Minister of Culture to discuss staging Zuckerberg vs Musk at the famous Colosseum in Rome – one of the seven wonders of the world. However, Zuckerberg is now expressing doubts over the fight taking place after writing in a post on his new social-media site Threads, ‘If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me’. Over the weekend, Musk also leaked a screenshot of his private messages with Zuckerberg, who reacted negatively to a request for a ‘practice bout’ at his mansion in Palo Alto. Zuckerberg built an Octagon at the property earlier this month in preparation for his potential clash with Musk, leaving his wife Priscilla Chan furious. American author Walter Isaacson, who wrote a biography on Musk which is due to be released next month, shared a photo on X of the South African sending him the exchange with Zuckerberg and writing: ‘Wow.’ In the screenshot, the Meta chief responded to Musk’s challenge for a practice bout in his Octagon and said: ‘If you still want to do a real MMA fight, then you should train on your own and let me know when you’re ready to compete. “I don’t want to keep hyping something that will never happen, so you should either decide you’re going to do this and do it soon, or we should move on.” According to Business Insider, Musk’s full reply was, “I have not been practicing much, apart from a brief bout with Lex Fridman today. “While I think it is very unlikely, given our size difference, perhaps you are a modern-day Bruce Lee and will somehow win.’ Zuckerberg’s Threads post about Musk all but confirms the leaked messages were a genuine exchange between the two men, as he spoke out on the practice bout offer and doubted his rival’s willingness to entertain a real contest. “I offered a real date. [UFC president] Dana White offered to make this a legit competition for charity,’ he said. “Elon won’t confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead. “If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me. Otherwise, time to move on. I’m going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously.”",

      "title": "Elon Musk Admits Joking About Cage-Fight With Mark Zuckerberg",
      "text": "In an interesting turn in the Elon Musk-Mark Zuckerberg much-anticipated ‘cage fight', both tech leaders again entered an indirect war of words. Initially, Zuckerberg posted on Instagram story, “Send me the location” along with the screenshot of Musk's tweet where he had first challenged the Meta owner. Responding to this, the X-owner accused Zuckerberg of apparently not accepting the challenge. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Musk stated, “Fight Recap: I joked on X about fighting Zuck, Zuck then said “SEND ME LOCATION” Italy graciously offered a Colosseum Zuck declined I suggested his home as “safe space” Tragically, he was ahem “travelling” Is there anywhere he will fight?” Earlier on Sunday, Zuckerberg in a cryptic post, gave the impression that he has backed off from the fight. In a post on Threads, he said that he was going to \"focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously\". \"I think we can all agree Elon isn't serious and it's time to move on. I offered a real date. Dana White offered to make this a legit competition for charity. Elon won't confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead,\" he said in the post. This didn't go down well with Musk, who took to X and threw some jabs at his tech rival. “Zuck is a chicken,” Musk posted. As per Variety, the Meta and X/Twitter CEOs first sparked conversations about a potential MMA-style cage match in a series of back-and-forth messages on their platforms. Musk kicked off the exchange while replying to a June 20 Twitter thread where he wrote, “I'm up for a cage match if he is lol.” Recently Musk posted that the “Zuck v Musk fight” would be live-streamed via X with all proceeds going to charity. Zuckerberg fired back at Musk, taking a subtle dig at X/Twitter, when he wrote on Threads, “Shouldn't we use a more reliable platform that can actually raise money for charity?” (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

      "title": "Elon Musk Says One Of The Most Difficult Choices He Ever Had To Make Was When He Had 'Just $30 Million Left'",
      "text": "Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, revealed that one of the toughest choices he’s had to make in his life was when he had “$30 million dollars left.” Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, revealed that choosing which company to invest his last $30 million in was tough. In a conversation with screenwriter, producer and director Jonathan Nolan during a SXSW interview titled “Elon Musk Answers Your Questions!”, Musk shared his insights on topics ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) to Mars and business. He delved into his early entrepreneurial years, which ultimately led to the creation of his groundbreaking companies, including how he made $180 million from the sale of PayPal. Don’t Miss: Until 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups. Thanks to changes in federal law, this Kevin O'Leary-Backed Startup Lets You Become a Venture Capitalist With $100 After discussing what a brutal year 2008 was for Musk because of the third consecutive failure of the Falcon rocket for SpaceX and going through divorce, he explained SpaceX and Tesla are “alive by the skin of their teeth.” If things had just gone a little bit the other way, he says both companies would be dead. “One of the most difficult choices I have ever faced in life was in 2008,” Musk said. “I think I had maybe $30 or $40 million dollars left in 2008 and two choices. I could put it all into one company and then the other company would definitely die. Or split it between the two companies.” While choosing how to allocate his last $30 million constitutes a major decision, it’s not a narrative that necessarily tugs at the heartstrings or evokes sympathy. The excerpt from the video shared on various social media platforms was edited, turning it into black and white with emotional piano music, adding a touch of satirical drama. It’s fair to say, people in the comments were rather unsympathetic to his struggle. Looking to be a part of the next big thing?

Musk continued the interview, emphasizing the weight of his dilemma. “And when you put your blood, sweat and tears into creating something or building something, it’s like a child. So, it’s like which one — am I gonna let one starve to death? I couldn’t bring myself to do it, so I split the money between the two. Fortunately, thank goodness, they both came through.’ According to Bloomberg, SpaceX narrowly secured a game-changing $1.6 billion NASA contract, which provided the company with a significant lifeline, ensuring its stability. Meanwhile, investors came through with $40 million in new funding to rescue Tesla on Christmas Eve, just hours before the company would have exhausted its remaining resources, which were dwindling to just a few hundred thousand dollars. Now Musk is the richest man in the world, with a net worth of $225.3 billion, reported by Forbes.

      "title": "Hate-speech watchdog CEO fires back at Elon Musk, says he put up ‘bat signal’ to ‘racists’ and ‘homophobes’",
      "text": "The head of an online hate-speech watchdog has spoken out against Elon Musk after the business tycoon's X Corp., the parent company of the social media app formerly known as Twitter, filed a lawsuit against the nonprofit. In a lawsuit filed Monday in California, X Corp. claimed The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) published \"misleading claims\" and exaggerated the prevalence of harmful content on X to thwart investment from advertisers. X Corp. said the \"scare campaign\" was accomplished by illegally scraping data and cherry-picking inflammatory posts to support the CCDH's thesis about hate speech on the platform. During a Tuesday appearance on \"CNN This Morning,\" CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed stood by the group's reports on X. He said they have been \"incredibly transparent\" about the methodology used to support their claims. 'STAR WARS' ACTOR THREATENS ELON MUSK WITH TWITTER BOYCOTT AFTER NAME REBRAND: 'LET'S SHOW THE OWNER' Ahmed also reaffirmed that Twitter saw an increase in hate speech around the time that Musk took over. \"The truth is that [Musk's] been casting around for a reason to blame us for his own failings as a CEO, because we all know that when he took over, he put up the bat signal to racists, to misogynists, to homophobes, to anti-Semites, saying Twitter is now a free speech platform. He welcomed them back on,\" Ahmed said. Speaking to one of the studies, Ahmed revealed the CCDH took 100 random tweets containing \"hate\" from Twitter Blue accounts and reported it to the platform using the site's internal tools. TWITTER USERS UP IN ARMS AFTER MUSK'S 'X' NAME CHANGE: 'RIP TWITTER' He claimed that in 99 out of 100 cases, Twitter, now known as X, failed to enforce their community standards on the posts. \"All we do is hold up a mirror to the platform and ask them to consider whether or not they like the reflection they see in it,\" Ahmed continued. \"Never before has one of these social media companies, and we, of course, analyze all social media companies without fear or favor. But when others don't like the reflection, they seek to change it. What Mr. Musk has done is said, I'm going to sue the mirror because I don't like what I see inside it.\" When asked what impact the lawsuit could have on watchdog groups, Ahmed also said the lawsuit would have \"a chilling effect\" across the civil rights sector. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Ahmed said Musk will \"stop at nothing\" to silence those who criticize his decisions and actions, noting that the latest legal threat is \"straight out of the authoritarian playbook.\" Ahmed also said that their research shows hate and disinformation on the platform is \"spreading like wildfire\" under Musk's ownership. \"People don’t want to see or be associated with hate, antisemitism, and the dangerous content that we all see proliferating on X. Musk is trying to ‘shoot the messenger’ who highlights the toxic content on his platform rather than deal with the toxic environment he’s created. The CCDH’s independent research won’t stop - Musk will not bully us into silence,\" he added. AOC LASHES OUT AT TWITTER, CLAIMS SHE'S 'NEVER EXPERIENCED MORE HARASSMENT' BEFORE In a Monday blog post, the CCDH said the legal threats from X are a \"brazen attempt to silence honest criticism and independent research.\" \"CCDH believes the public has a right to know about the spread of hate and misinformation on the social media platforms that shape our lives, culture, and politics,\" the group added. Twitter did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For more Culture, Media, Education, Opinion, and channel coverage, visit foxnews.com/media",

      "title": "Elon Musk steals more Twitter handles, domain war with OpenAI: What&#8217;s brewing at X?",
      "text": "A few weeks ago, we reported how Elon Musk reportedly did not pay the original owner of the handle @X. Well, now it seems Chief Twit is at it again. Even as Twitter enters the final laps of its transformation of its rebranded self as X, several more handles seem to have been taken over by Musk. In July, after Musk announced the rebranding of Twitter as X and ditched the history bluebird logo, questions were swirling around what will be the official handle henceforth. However, adding to the pandemonium, Musk went on to take over the X handle which was owned by Sana Francisco-based photographer Gene X Hwang. While the photographer’s hopes to be remunerated for the sudden usurpation, there were reports that suggested that no such attempt were made by the 52-year-old billionaire. Cut to August, now it seems Musk’s platform has gone on to take over handles like @music, @sports, etc. The company has also been rebranding some of the accounts as @Twittermusic, @twittermovies, @twittersports, @twittertv, etc. A user identified as Jeremy Vaught said that he created the @music handle some 16 years ago, and that he has been running it ever since. However, now the handle has been taken over by Musk. “16 years ago, I created @music and have been running it ever since. Just now, Twitter / X just ripped it away. Super pissed,” tweeted Vaught. Meanwhile, X also took over @movies and @tv handles and renamed it. All this has been happening, and there has been no official clarification or announcement from the X team. What’s in the domain? In February, it came to be known that OpenAI had reportedly registered the AI.com domain which was to be redirected to ChatGPT web. Now, it seems the 52-year-old technocrat may have snatched the domain from Sam Altman’s company. Although domains being bought and sold are a routine affair, when it comes to two-letter.com domains, it's a rarity. This is because they are expensive and all the more costly if they are commonly known abbreviations. Interestingly, in the last two days the AI.com domain which redirected to ChatGPT, redirected to Elon Musk’s xAI, an AI company owned by him. xAI is different from X Corp and on its official website it claims to ‘work closely with X’. “The goal of xAI is to understand the true nature of the universe. We will share more information over the next couple of weeks and months,” reads the opening lines of the homepage of xAI.com. In February, Saw.com, a domain broker, claimed that they were responsible for transferring AI.com to OpenAI. This made it easier for ChatGPT users to logon to the web version.While it is not clear yet if Musk has officially taken over the AI.com domain. Reportedly, Musk had invested in OpenAI some four years ago when the company was in its nascent stage. It is also known that Musk had held different roles in the company. Now that he has floated his own AI company, it is only obvious that the Tesla chief is eying to overthrow the dominance of OpenAI in the AI realm.",
