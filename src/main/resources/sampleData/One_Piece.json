      "title": "Choreographers Bobbi Jene Smith and Or Schraiber Explore Togetherness - LA Weekly",
      "text": "For dancers and choreographers Bobbi Jene Smith and Or Schraiber, life has become a long and lovely pas de deux. After their overlapping years with legendary Batsheva Dance Company, they’ve pursued a multitude of independent performance and production projects — like the stunning dance film Aviva, a host of innovative movement works with dance and music companies around the world, and a beautiful young daughter. The pair, both in their own work and in their collaborations, is known for their uniquely expressive language of movements, which range from the bright and angular to the jaunty and syncopated, natural and stylized, intensely emotional, muscular, sensual, witty, graceful, moody, seemingly spontaneous, and always unexpected. They’ve been closely associated with internationally acclaimed, intentionally accessible company L.A. Dance Project (LADP) as well — and it’s there that they are currently in residence, and in the throes of creation on their latest collaborative work, Missing Mountain, an extension of their acclaimed 2019 work Lost Mountain, which will have its premiere in September. L.A. Weekly caught up with the pair between sessions to talk about the new piece, navigating collaboration, and what ties it all together. L.A. WEEKLY: Thank you so much for letting me watch last week’s rehearsal — it was really illuminating. Watching the whole company be fully present, engaged with what other performers were thinking through, working things out with you both and each other before putting all the pieces together. It seemed so collaborative and organic, and yet it’s your vision, your ideas, and you are both dancers used to expressing yourselves directly in movement. So what comes first when you go to build a whole original work from the ground up? BOBBI JENE SMITH: Well, I think for me, it feels like the people always come first. I’m always kind of trying to understand the elements in the room and the different combinations of artists that are there, and trying to then create an atmosphere or to create a circumstance that would bring these people together. So even if that’s like a dreamscape or a landscape or a scenario or a song, you meet at a dinner party and crazy things happen, or they all meet in this one dream and they never see each other again. It starts there. Because I feel like we all can empathize with that. We all kind of understand and we can all get lost in what it is to dream and then to forget. And that’s what I love so much about contemporary dance, is how it feels. LAW: I love that answer because it’s almost counterintuitive. One could imagine you saying, well, I read this short story or I heard this song or it’s about my parents or my divorce, or climate change or human rights — and then you’d start building it to serve that. But what I hear you saying is that it’s almost the opposite. BJS: It’s like almost trying to create enough space so people can fill in all of those things they need to. But, you know, trying to do that, it comes from a very personal place. But then it can also go very universal in a sense of letting people come towards it. It’s like saying come, come with us. You know how to do this. You have all the tools. You don’t need to know anything else. LAW: Knowing that in works like Quartet for Five and a number of other LADP pieces that the cast often changes, how does that all come out? How much input do the performers have as it takes shape? BJS: So many things start to get decided in the room without trying to make a decision. Certain people gravitate to each other. Certain people don’t. Certain people have conflict or tension that’s healthy and important. Rather than saying, we need this. How can you give us this? We tried to just say, like, what is there already? Who’s here? And then trying to amplify and play with volume and — oh, this person tends to do this. Let’s try to turn that up. Or could we oppose that? And then just play with the options. OR SCHRAIBER: I think it’s also connected to what Bobbi said about the fact that the cast will always be — or the people in the room will always be — the people who inform the piece. So there is a piece and if there is another cast all of a sudden, which happens all the time, the piece morphs, the piece changes and the piece is alive. And that’s kind of like one of the goals, actually. And then in terms of our process of working together, I think we’re still finding that every piece is different. In terms of roles, it varies all the time. We talk a lot. We argue a lot. We keep on brainstorming all the time. Constantly. We go home after the studio, in the car on the way home. It’s like in the middle of the night, first thing in the morning before saying good morning. It’s like a constant. Hey, wake up! I personally love it. It’s very intense and the frequency is like the highest it can be. BJS: And I think for this process, it’s been interesting because we started our residency at LADP with the idea of trying to recreate an older piece called Lost Mountain. And in doing so, it started to morph into a new piece, which I love. And a part of me was like, you knew that was going to happen. It has elements from another older work called Caldera and from the sister piece Lost Mountain, and now it becomes a trilogy with this new work. Caldera was a place that the people never got out of. It was a space that they were stuck in. Lost Mountain was a place they passed through. And this piece now, Missing Mountain, they begin being stuck, but eventually, they leave. And I like those three different ways around it, and how there are elements of both of those earlier pieces coming back and finding new expressions inside this piece, but then there are brand new elements that are so specific to the people in it now, and where Or and I are at in our lives now. OS: So maybe there is a narrative, but it’s not a linear narrative. It’s not like a story. It’s a different way of looking at plots or at characters. BJS: We all know what it’s like, trying to listen really closely to those small moments that we all recognize in our own lives. Like that one look that changed, that made you decide the big decision? How can we fall in love with someone and then be also upset by the choices they make and then love them again? And how can we kind of put all of those little moments into this piece — the ones that maybe we missed when they were happening. Or when we look back on it, we think, Oh, that was the thing. Or it becomes kind of outsized in retrospect. What would have been different if he hadn’t gotten there right then, or that song had or had not come on, or the letter was or was not delivered… LAW: Is it hard for you to not just do it yourselves? OS: That’s an amazing question. I don’t know. It’s like this question has like five, 15 million questions within it. Yes. For me, yes. I sometimes, especially when I see, you know, the camaraderie and the togetherness and the listening and the connection of the people who are performing or just doing a run. I’m not only talking about performance, doing a run in the studio or running one section, and I’m sitting and seeing it from outside. It’s like I have this urge in me, I want to charge. I want to go and be there with them. I want to feel what they feel. And so I’m assuming that’s proof of them doing the right thing in the right way! Because they’re really conveying something. You know, I played soccer for many years and sitting on the bench was really tough for me because you always want to go in, not just from a place of showing off your skills, but also to be there for your teammates. And it’s something that I always have in mind when other people are doing our pieces, yeah, I always want to go and support from inside, even just sitting on a sofa, not necessarily dancing, just be there with them and for them. BJS: I mean, I feel like each case is so different. And it’s also what the place is, what the circumstance is. I find both roles really informative and that they feed each other. I hope that we’re always going to be dancing and still connected. To show up for performances is a really important thing because I feel like it keeps us close to the dancers and it always keeps things in check like, Yes this is hard. It takes a lot of strength and it’s amazing and it’s fun and the more you give, the more it will give you. That love for it, I think it really is powerful and yes, it’s also really hard to be in it and to be outside of it at the same time. But I also have to say, that exchange with the dancers, for me, I find that so precious. I feel like each one of them brings themselves. Seeing how people bring themselves to what we do makes things much larger than we could ever be without them. There’s one part in the new piece, we call it The Hopeful Parents. And it’s taken from an older piece we made when we were expecting our daughter and I was pregnant and we made that duet. And, you know, before coming to L.A., I don’t think we’d ever have thought about doing it with someone else. You know, it felt so personal. It was like only Or and Bobbi can do it. I remember people even saying that about us. Yeah, it was made at a specific time. It’s very private and personal. But it gives me so much joy to see them do it now. And they do it amazingly. And I feel like they do it better than we did it. And they bring other colors and more life to it. And that feels incredible, too. LAW: What about your relationship to music, partly because your taste is so omnivorous, right? Like there’ll be western canon of classical right next to niche singer/songwriters that I can barely find online. So how and when does music become a part of it? BJS: I feel like it’s different for each piece. Each piece has its own musical journey. Sometimes the music was given to us. This piece is commissioned. We stick to it. We try to find the world of it. We try to justify why it’s there. I think of trying to use music as a character in itself, like, what’s the music of this room? Almost thinking of it as tone of the room, of the dream, of the space. Are there interruptions? Is it like the radio was turned on? What song would this character listen to? I love to think about things like, you know what if Tom Waits and Connie Converse and Nina Simone all could meet, and they’re in that dream, and how can we create different meetings of music in our pieces? And then the pure idea of what gets people dancing. What sounds familiar. I love playing with what sounds familiar to an audience and how that lets people go in further, opens emotions and helps them let go. OS: The composer that we’re working with, except for the excerpt you heard, he’s going to make the room tone that Bobbi spoke about. His name is Yonatan Daskal. He’s a dear collaborator of ours. We’ve worked on various pieces in the past. He’s just amazing. LAW: But also, too, when you are working with, say, a classical piece, but you’re thinking about movement in a contemporary way. So what is that space like? Like, does it pull you back into your classical training? Do you have to fight against that? Those rhythms weren’t necessarily made for how we move today. Or were they? OS: I love putting on like the Bach cantatas and seeing where our movement collides. And I find that collision really interesting, of where our bodies are now with the sound from then and, and how maybe it brings out other things in the music or it makes my body do different things that I wouldn’t normally do. I love that relationship and how it brings out, you know, younger versions of myself or much older versions of myself. Many times I love making movements to silence, so I don’t have any beat or groove or meter in my head because I go OCD. It’s the collision, like Bobbi said, the collision of sound and movement, all of the different grooves and rhythms all of a sudden are so out there for me and so odd in a way that really turns me on. It creates a whole different emotion than what I created without the music. And that just baffles me every time. And it’s amazing. The evening-length work will be shown for six performances only: September 14, 15, 16 & 28, 29, 30 in Downtown Los Angeles.

      "title": "The best Baldur’s Gate 3 spells",
      "text": "What are all the Baldur’s Gate 3 spells? While the RPG game is based on Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, not every 5e spell is available in BG3 – and not every class can use every spell. Therefore, knowing which spells are at your disposal comes in handy. Sure, you might be able to hurl a Fireball at your enemies – it’s a classic move, after all – but there are hundreds of other spells that might take your Baldur’s Gate 3 foes by surprise, with a variety of positive, negative, and even hilarious results. Whichever of the Baldur’s Gate 3 classes or races you choose to play, you can have the option to cast spells thanks to multiclassing, so knowing which compliment your other skills and abilities is essential. That said, here’s all the BG3 spells available to magic users. Best Baldur’s Gate 3 spells Here are the best BG3 spells: There are over 200 spells at launch, with over 600 confirmed by Larian to be added to the game overall. If you aren’t sure where to start with that, we’ve chosen a few of the best spells to get you started in Baldur’s Gate 3, whichever class you choose. Speak with Animals The ability to speak with animals might not be the first thing that springs to mind when considering spells, but thanks to the hilarious and varied gameplay in Baldur’s Gate 3, we can promise you will want Speak with Animals prepared when the time comes. It’s also one of the BG3 ritual spells, meaning you can use it as much as you like outside of combat – without using up valuable skill slots. Detect Thoughts Detect Thoughts is often a handy spell in Dungeons and Dragons and Baldur’s Gate, as it can get you out of some tricky situation against deceptive foes. Not sure if someone if with you or against you? Detect thoughts will tell you true…. if your roll succeeds. Fireball The classic DnD spell, Fireball has to be included as one of the best for its excellent damage. At just level 3, Fireball can deal up to 8d6 damage, one of the greatest amounts of damage at such a low level. And that’s before you consider Fireball’s legendary status. It’s a must-have for any self-respecting sorcerer, wizard, or warlock. Lesser Restoration Lesser Restoration is a useful spell to have in your team comp, on your party’s Druid or Cleric. You should not be without some healing capabilities when you head out on an adventure if you don’t want a total party kill to hit hard, and be ensuring you have a low-level spell like Lesser Restoration available will allow anyone on your team to be healed of one status effect or other condition. It can also remove the Bloodless status effect, which might come in handy with Astarion around. All Baldur’s Gate 3 spells by category With so many spells in game, this is a pretty hefty guide, so if you’re after something specific, you can jump straight to a spell category using the links below. We’ve also got a section on how to use BG3 spells. If you need to know which spells your class can use, we’d recommend using your browser search (Ctrl + F), and search your class.

Luffy’s transformation is complete as he fully awakens his incredible Devil Fruit power. The Five Elders at Mary Geoise discuss their desperate attempts to obtain the Gomu Gomu no Mi, a Paramecia fruit that mysteriously evaded them, though it is also a mythical Zoan fruit, granting the user the power of the sun god Nika. After recovering, Luffy emits an incredibly powerful Haoshoku Haki, reaching even the Beasts Pirates below. He seizes Kaidou’s dragon form and brings him back to the rooftop, where he delivers a fierce beating with little resistance. Kaidou tries to fight back with a Bolo Breath, but Luffy cleverly blocks it using his rubber-like abilities, causing the fireball to hit Kaidou instead. Despite being unable to defeat Luffy, Kaidou is relieved to see him alive, feeling guilty for relying on Guernica’s help. Meanwhile, in the treasure repository, Orochi tries to persuade Hiyori to remove his Seastone nail and set him free. However, Hiyori, angered by Orochi’s betrayals and wrongdoings, firmly refuses. Kazenbo, who had been reduced to a small wisp during an armory explosion, reappears and takes matters into its own hands. Instead of obeying Orochi’s orders, Kazenbo sets him on fire as he remains trapped under the rubble.

      "title": "Islamic Art in Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon part II – The Frontier Post",
      "text": "A. Peter Dore The Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon’s collection of Near Eastern artifacts eloquently showcases the intricate tapestry of Islamic cultures, from Arabic lamps embodying prayer to Persian ceramics portraying deep love and Turkish plates harmonizing creative unity, all reflecting the interwoven complexities of aesthetics, religion and symbolism across history Here I want to complete my review of the Near Eastern artifacts of The Museum of Fine Arts (Musée des Beaux-Arts) in the French city of Lyon with a piece on some of the Islamic art from this region that it displays. All the featured works are from a permanent exhibition space in the museum that is located on its first floor. I have chosen here from among the Arabic, Persian and Turkish artifacts. The works in this piece necessarily raise the issue of what the expert in Islamic art, David Talbot Rice, refers to as “the ban on representation of living figures, which is generally believed to be a characteristic of Islamic art.” The Arabic and Turkish works I have selected feature no human or animal figures, whereas two of the Persian pieces feature both. I do not feel it is my place to touch on the theological issue here, I wish merely to point out that it is a historical fact that this ban was not, as Talbot Rice notes, “ever universally enforced with regard to secular art in later times” or at the beginning of the hereditary caliphates. The Persian works that I have chosen are certainly secular, though, as I will demonstrate below, a brief look at Persian poetry suggests that one of them could carry a religious meaning as well. Arabic art The two Arabic artifacts I have selected both connect to the second of the five pillars of Islam, the ritual prayer that is performed five times daily. Firstly though, I should note that when I initially saw the first item, I thought I had come face-to-face with a familiar friend. The mosque lamps looked like the ones decorating the cover of my copy of “A History of the Arab Peoples” by Albert Hourani; however, they are in fact slightly different. Yet, they both come from Egypt, they are both 14th-century works, and both were commissioned by leading figures in the state. They belong to what Martin Birk Moller calls “the golden age of Islamic glass art.” Moreover, Talbot Rice regards their specific type of glasswork, known as enameled glass, as being at the apogee of all Islamic glasswork, and these lamps being the apogee of enameled glasswork, with the best examples being produced in Egypt or Syria. The Lyon piece was made for the Mamluk Egyptian Sultan Barquq, who was obviously a keen connoisseur of these exquisite items as 59 lamps commissioned for him survive even to the present day. As a mosque lamp it would have been filled with olive oil, hung from the six regular holed projections on its side, and a taper lit in it so that it would cast its gentle light over the congregated believers in the mosque for the three prayers that are not performed during daylight, namely those of the evening, night and dawn. It makes one think of Kang Youwei’s remark about the “countless … oil lamps” hanging over the believers in Hagia Sophia, showing how this tradition continued down into the 20th century when it was replaced by electric lighting. Before a Muslim is able to pray, however, they must do a ritual ablution. If they pray at home, in the time before the advent of indoor plumbing, they would use a jug or a ewer. In the Lyon museum, there is a particularly eye-catching gilded silver ewer, embossed with Thuluth calligraphy, a style that would be developed in the Ottoman Empire. This ewer also belonged to an elite Egyptian from the Mamluk era, the Emir Gawhar al-Mu’ini, although it is a century later than the lamp. It is perhaps a symbolic piece in that though an emir, Gawhar al-Mu’ini would also have been the sultan’s cupbearer. With its sleek and stark lines, it has an air of urgency about it which, for me, is amplified by the handle which suggests an arm impatiently grasping its hip. Thus, the whole work seems to be encouraging the believer to be timely and not tardy in preparing for their devotions. Before moving on to the Persian artworks in the Lyon Museum, I would here like to express my thanks to Othob Alzaidi who has helped me with these Arabic items. Persian art In the section on Persian art, the 19th-century pen case would have failed to attract my attention but for its literary association. Yet, the deeply troubled narrator of Sadegh Hedayat’s “The Blind Owl,” one of my all-time favorite books, is a Persian pen case illustrator, so this piece in Lyon caught my eye. It is true that the depiction upon it is not, as in Hedayat, of a young woman clad in black under a cypress tree offering a flower to a man bent up beneath it. Nevertheless, its similarity to the one related to Hedayat’s novella is remarkable. Both feature a woman, whose, in Hedayat’s words, “beauty” is “extraordinary,” with an enigmatic smile, thick black hair and arresting eyebrows over hypnotic eyes. Moreover, while she is not directly under a cypress tree, there are trees including cypresses, framing the picture at the top. Next to the pen case cover is a floral book cover. Nevertheless, there is a more exquisite work from a similar time and type nearby. This is labeled as “Leaves of a Shutter” and at a mere 47.4 by 37.4 centimeters it must have acted as a shutter for a mirror. It is wooden and has been painted and gilded. It is simply a masterpiece of decorative art. Contrast has been used in the two main background colors of scarlet red and navy blue to heighten the effect of both, and draw one’s eye immediately to the curved heart of the piece that has some kinship in shape to that of the dome of an Iranian mosque. Atop these background colors is the lavish floral decoration, with different kinds of flowers in a naturalistic style. Their colors are harmonious both with each other and the background which is a difficult effect to achieve when so many different ones are involved. The word beautiful seems off for a piece as daintily produced as this. Calling it supremely pretty conveys its sense better. There is also a ceramic piece on display here. It is labeled “A Horseman and a Horsewoman” and it is a 19th-century tile from Tehran. It depicts two lovers courteously meeting on horseback. Although they incline their heads bashfully away from one another, they only have eyes for one another. The inclination of the woman under her dainty parasol is more pronounced because, in Persian art, a coy tilting of a woman’s head betokens that she is in love. This coyness does not incapacitate her, however, since she is also holding her right hand out to him. Love has blinded them to all else around them, be it their animal companions such as the little dog yapping to get its master’s attention or their mounts that seem also to be involved in flirtatious activity, thus intensifying the overall theme of the piece. What is more, the human lovers have their heads inclined away from what are homes or palaces and a mosque or shrine, the concerns of the material or spiritual life being washed away in a sea of love, the metaphor of the sea suggested by the deep blue background to the piece. This suggests the way in which the key theme of Persian poetry, the exclusiveness of love, is portrayed. A well-known tale in Farid ud-Din Attar’s “The Conference of the Birds” is about a highly respected sheikh who is suddenly smitten when he catches sight of a Christian princess. The violence of his passion causes him to undergo a radical change of character. He turns away from all he had been before and even gives up “religion’s wealth for shame” in that he abandons all of his former pious practices to wallow in the dust before this woman’s home, as his love for her has become all to him. Yet, the issue of love in Persian poetry is more complex than it may at first appear. The general interpretation is that the human love it shows is a metaphor for the absolute love a true believer ought to feel for God. Thus, this ceramic could also be read metaphorically as a religious piece. Turkish Art Before moving on to Turkish works, I would like to make a point that may enhance their appreciation. It is that while many art forms are based upon rules, if there is a sufficient degree of creativity in the artist then within these rules a great deal of imaginative variation can still emerge. All of the plates that I will deal with here are, save perhaps the first, 16th-century pieces from Iznik in Türkiye and they were produced with an understanding of design rules concerning motifs. Ernst J. Grube argues that these “motifs are almost exclusively floral, realistic, and particularly sensitive in design.” I take issue with the idea that the flowers on the plates are “realistic” and incline more to the view of Simon Trethewey who states: “The flower forms, although occasionally recognizable as the rose or tulip or others are generally not of a type that exists in this world. The intention was to take the motif away from the particularity of an individual flower and to move it closer to an archetypal form, one more reminiscent of the unity behind all flowers.” Despite the disagreement, the rule pertaining to Iznik pottery is that the designs be floral. They are also polychromatic, though this tends to be within a relatively limited color palate. This still allows for each plate to be very much an individual work of art, presumably reflecting the perspective of its maker. The first plate that I will examine is called “Plate Decorated with Flowers and Radiating Petals.” In its design, despite its cool blue color, the flower in the center seems to resemble the sun pulsing with energy. Then there are the eight symmetrical radiating petals with their continuity in color which resemble the rays of the sun, carriers of its beneficent heat and life-giving powers. Moreover, their indication of the cardinal compass points makes a further connection with the sun, these points on Earth being determined by it. All in all, this explains why when looking at the plate, one feels a sense of warmth rather than the cold that one would associate with this dominance of blue. The whole piece can also be regarded as symbolic of divine grace reaching out over all of creation. A nearby plate is labeled as “Plate Decorated with Roses and Cypresses.” In terms of color and its white spaces, it makes one think of Piet Mondrian. Yet, in its limitation to the three primary colors of red, green and blue, Mondrian would use yellow in place of green. It is the most geometric of the works on display here. Reflecting a strong concern for symmetry, this plate is clearly divided into quarters by the turquoise cypresses the stems of whose bases spring out of the central rose. Although the images on the plate are obviously botanical, in no way are they depicted as individual manifestations but rather they are reduced to a type, their fundamental essence, much like the goal to which Mondrian strives. In comparison with the other plates on display here, this is the most austere. It has a very controlled feeling to it and despite its nominal use of plant life, it makes no real concession to the messiness of botanical nature, seeking its inspiration instead from metaphysical perfection. I would imagine that the artist of this plate is motivated by powerful yet simple religious feelings. In one sense, the nearby plate entitled “Concave Plate with a Central Bouquet” is similar to it, in that it too uses the same limited colors and much of the plate is undecorated in any way. Nevertheless, this plate celebrates nature and life in its diversity. This does not, of course, mean that aspersions should be cast as to the relative piety of its artist vis-a-vis that of one of the previous plates. In this case, by celebrating creation this piece can easily be read as glorifying the Creator. It does this by representing more flower types and the blooms as individualized flowers. Moreover, with the same flower shown as a bud and bloom it also depicts change, the essence of life. Furthermore, some flowers cross over others, which also symbolizes life with its complex entanglements. The Islamic taboo on the depiction of human life has, along with the other plates in this collection, been strictly adhered to here. Yet, I cannot help but see something of an anthropomorphic spirit on this plate. The five largest flowers are not simply individualized, they also appear human-like. In the case of the tulips on the left, they seem to possess a sense of inquisitiveness, casting a shaded eye over what is going on in front of them. As for the rose at the top, it appears to want to be left alone in peace as it has turned its back, or stem, on everything. The small blue tulip on the right looks as if it has met up with the other rose as far away as possible from the others in order to have a private conversation out of earshot, with the rose perhaps attempting to force the shy and reluctant tulip to engage in a bit of talk. The final plate I want to look at is called “Plate of Carnations and Hyacinths.” Although the plate itself is presumably as sturdy as all the others, the small blue hyacinths as well as the use of a light watery green for the stems give it an air of great delicacy. Moreover, bold domineering reds are almost completely absent from this plate. Indeed, their limited use seems to be to increase the impact of the blue through the use of contrast. Although there are four downward-looking flowers at the bottom of the plate, two of them are miniscule and the clear direction of movement in this plate is upward. The blue tulips at the bottom of the plate stridently point toward the top. This suggests that they are striving for heaven. Then, the hyacinths on their reedy stems appear as a pair of arms stretching upward but also embracing the carnations between them. This suggests the idea that in reaching up for the Divine, it is necessitated that the fate of others must also be attended to. The carnations, the flowers that have come closest to the top of the plate, have turned their gazes aside as if such proximity to the Creator is more than their souls can bear and they have to humbly turn away. The Iznik plates on display in the Lyon Museum demonstrate a multiplicity within uniformity that is also manifested in the other works. As such, all of these works are representative not only of the art of the religious culture in which they were produced but also of that culture itself. Courtesy: Dailysabah",

      "title": "How do fans in Japan feel about the new One Piece Netflix live-action trailer?",
      "text": "The live-action adaptation of the beloved anime/manga is almost here, but will it be smooth sailing into the hearts of fans in the series’ home country? It’s been more than six years since One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda announced that his smash hit pirate manga/anime franchise was getting a produced-in-America live-action adaptation, and more than three years since Netflix publicly became the company making it happen. Now that we’re less than two months away from the premiere of the Netflix One Piece, the streaming giant is releasing the last sneak peeks at the series, with the latest trailer revealed just a few days ago. One Piece is a series with fans around the world, but it’s in its home country of Japan that it’s been a bona fide pop cultural juggernaut for the last two decades-plus. The previous Netflix One Piece trailer, from back in May, had many fans in Japan disappointed with how the live-action version of the Straw Hat Pirates’ ship looked, but how’s the reaction been to the new trailer? Extremely positive, at least as far as YouTube comments go. Sifting though the comments for the Japanese-subtitled version of the trailer (no dubbed-into-Japanese version currently exists), it’s hard to find any unhappy reactions, even if not everyone is 100-percent on board quite yet “I had so many worries about the adaptation, but after watching this, I can’t wait to see it!” “I like how they’re balancing loyalty to the source material and creating a natural, realistic atmosphere.” “I really like how it looks like instead of being a live-action anime, it’s like they’re going for what it’d be like if the world of One Piece existed in our reality.” “They aren’t going overboard on the setting or characterizations, but they’ve got a firm grasp on what makes them special, It’s a good balance for a fantasy story.” “When you adapt anime to live-action, it’s always going to feel at least a little like cosplay, but I think they’ve done an incredible job making it look this polished, so I’m looking forward to watching this.” “At first, I thought that Luffy felt like a totally different character, but watching this trailer, he’s won me over.” “I totally like how it doesn’t feel like a shonen manga, but a pirate series for adults.” “I’ve seen a lot of live-action adaptations of anime, but this is the first time a trailer has me this excited about watching one.” About as negative as things have gotten is: “My initial impression is that I don’t hate it, so that’s a big win for it so far.” “I’m worried about some of what I see in the acting and fight choreography, but this video still has me wanting to check the series out.” Perhaps part of the open-minded attitude comes from the fact that, at least within Japan, there’s zero chance of Netflix’s One Piece hurting the reputation of the One Piece anime/manga or replacing them in people’s as the minds as the primary image of what the story and characters are, considering how One Piece has been a pop culture institution for so many years here. That might be making it easier for even hardcore fans to think a little more flexibly about the adaptation and see it as an alternative take on what Oda created, especially with reactions like “This is exactly how a live-action adaptation should be. You can really feel the love that everyone involved has for the original series” and “Can’t say if it’s going to turn out well or not, but you can feel the love for the source material” showing that people appreciate that the changes that have been made don’t seem to be full-on subversions of what they love about One Piece. Netflix’s One Piece comes out on August 31. Source: YouTube/Netflix Japan Images: YouTube/Netflix ● Want to hear about SoraNews24’s latest articles as soon as they’re published?

      "title": "I ordered an £8 easyJet-friendly weekend bag from 'too good to be true' shopping site and it's brilliant",
      "text": "Finding the right size weekend bag that has enough room for clothes, shoes and accessories can be a challenge, but thanks to the latest online shopping craze, travellers like me are finding brilliant bags at bargain prices. The perfect weekend bag should be compact yet cavernous on the inside, with lots of handy pockets, extra compartments and both shoulder straps and hand grabs. With hundreds to choose from on the Temu app, jet setters are snapping up trendy travel bags that meet these requirements for less than the price of a sandwich at the airport. The Chinese-based app that is taking the UK by storm gives shoppers easy access to its online megastore. With the holiday season in full flight, the lure of cheap bags and travel accessories is proving hard for us Brits to ignore. Travellers looking for a bargain bag should consider the £8.98 Large Capacity Sports Bag. Measuring 51x32x25cm the duffel bag also meets the large cabin bag restrictions for easyJet making it an affordable option for holidaymakers taking a short break away. Unable to resist a bargain, I ordered the exact same bag for myself to see if the Temu app was worth the hype. The bag took five days to arrive and in my opinion, it looks good, feels durable enough and offers lots of lovely storage space. On the inside, there are two slip-in compartments and a separate zippered pocket, and on the bottom of the bag, there is a large zippered area that is perfect for storing shoes or dirty clothing. I managed to fit two pairs of shorts, a pair of jeans, three t-shirts, a hoodie, undies, socks and toiletries in with ease, and my sliders sat nicely in the bottom shoe compartment. According to the 365 product reviews on the Temu app, I wasn't the only satisfied customer. One happy shopper left a review saying: \"Love my bag looks just like the picture. I can fit loads in it\", while another described the bag as being \"Ideal for weekend outings and for the gym to be able to separate clean clothes from sneakers.\" A third simply expressed their delight, saying \"Love Love Love this weekender bag, it is perfect. Good quality and great size.\" With over 7 million Brits having already downloaded the Temu app that looks too good to be true, the shopping site is well on its way to challenging Shein and Wish when it comes to popularity. When adverts for Temu started popping up on social media, would-be buyers questioned the legitimacy of the site. To help reassure shoppers, Temu now offers customers money back as part of their Purchase Protection Program - which means if an order is damaged, doesn't arrive, or doesn't look like its online listing, it is eligible for a refund when returned within 90 days of purchase. Some customers have been put off by the longer estimated delivery times. The app claims that most items will be delivered within 10 working days, and mine arrived much quicker, but for shoppers who are not prepared to wait that long, online shopping stalwart Amazon also offers an impressive range of travel bags. This slightly smaller but equally as stylish weekend bag, for example, is a good alternative at £16.99, while frequent flyers looking to maximise their packing space could upgrade to this overnight travel duffel at £22.99. Amazon also offers suitcases, cabin cases and weekend bags available with free next-day delivery for Prime members and the return process is quick and straightforward. Before you buy, passengers should familiarise themselves with the most up-to-date luggage restrictions for UK airlines.

      "title": "Pilobolus’ Big Five-OH!",
      "text": "“We started talking about what it means to dream,” Renee Jaworski tells me over the phone while her dance company rehearses in the other room. “What does it mean to ‘sleep on something’? When you go to bed trying to solve a problem, and then you sleep on it, and you wake up, and either the problem just goes away because it wasn’t really a problem in the first place, or you have a new idea of how to approach it. There are things that are happening in your brain—and in your psyche—while you sleep that affect the real world. And sometimes you have anxiety dreams, right? You’ll be like—Oh, I dreamt my house was on fire last night. That’s definitely because I’m nervous about The Joyce next week,” she laughs. “You know? There are reasons that you have specific dreams.” This conversation reminds me of one I might have had in a psychology class or with a close friend or maybe even a therapist. But Jaworski (Executive/Co-Artistic Director of Pilobolus) and I have just met, and she is simply telling me about the inspiration for a new piece the Company will be showing at The Joyce Theater as part of a three-week engagement (July 11-30) marking the conclusion of its Big Five-OH! 50th Anniversary tour. The rapid depth of the conversation shouldn’t surprise me, though, because Pilobolus’s dancers are notoriously cerebral. The Company began at Dartmouth College in 1971 when a cross-country skier studying English literature, a fencer studying philosophy, and a pre-med pole vaulter all met in a dance composition class taught by a radical young woman. The Company has always been academically curious and interdisciplinary, with equal parts strapping bodies and big brains. Even their name is fascinating. Who knew there was a phototropic fungus whose spores could accelerate from 0 to 45 mph in the first millimeter of its flight? Not me, but they did. Don’t get me wrong. Pilobolus is not at all elitist. They are fun and accessible and very down-to-earth. And they are beloved. Over the years, Pilobolus has performed on Broadway, at the Oscars and the Olympic games. They have been featured on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, NBC’s TODAY Show, MTV’s Video Music Awards, The Harry Connick Show and ABC’s The Chew, among others. In 2015, the Company was named one of Dance Heritage Coalition’s “Irreplaceable Dance Treasures.” In 2011, Jaworski and Co-Artistic Director Matt Kent were chosen by the founding Artistic Directors to lead the Connecticut-based Company “into and beyond its post-succession evolution.” They have done that with skill and grace, and this tour is a testament to their leadership. The Big Five-OH! honors Pilobolus’s past while also offering glimpses into its future. It is a mix of fan favorites and new hits, featuring three New York premieres. The Big Five-OH! Both programs begin before they begin, with the Company flaunting its rebellious spirit by warming up right in front of us: bare stage, curtain up. At first glance, the six people look more like athletes than dancers. They wear elbow and knee pads, and their bodies are pure muscle. They drape each other over their shoulders and walk around. They stretch and do push-ups. Then, like teammates before a game, they form a huddle and talk—this part is not for us to hear—before leaning back into a primal scream and running off the stage to get ready for the real performance. Program A The program opens with a bang. Primus blasts over the empty stage, where a large mat reminiscent of a fighting ring waits. And waits. And then six heads appear from the wings, the bodies wiggle-worming their way toward center. This is Megawatt (2004), choreographed by founding member Jonathan Wolken (1949-2010) and restaged by Jaworski and Kent in his memory. The dancers move like electrons, like electricity, like electrocution. Then they throw themselves and each other to the ground, again and again, bodies slamming in play-fights. Any normal human who attempted 30 seconds of this choreography would end up in the hospital. Thankfully, these dancers are anything but typical, though Kent did say in a recent interview that Megawatt is a piece that the dancers must rehearse frequently to stay in shape “or they will be throwing up in the wings.” I do not doubt this at all. They come with all the energy—all the pow! bam! wow!—and it is a phenomenal feat. In the end, they are panting and half-laughing, and you might wonder how they could possibly keep going, but they do. Next, while the rest of the Company gets a break (frantically changing backstage out of one costume and into another), “Dance Captain” Nathaniel Buchsbaum performs a solo from the Empty Suitor (1980), another Pilobolus classic, choreographed by founding member Michael Tracy and set to Ben Webster’s “Sweet Georgia Brown.” The piece shows off another thing the Company does so well: humor. This particular brand of theatrical comedy is slapstick-y, almost Chaplin-esque, and full of props and antics. It is a delight. Evening Song (2023) is the Company’s “brand-spanking-new” piece about dreams that Jaworski was telling me about, which premiered only a few weeks ago at the American Dance Festival. The sound score, inspired by the disorienting act of falling asleep, was made by Jad Abumrad (of Radiolab fame). The choreography was created in collaboration with Derion Loman (former Company apprentice and dancer, and finalist on NBC’s America’s Got Talent and World of Dance) and partner Madison Olandt. The sextet is still finding its feet but is at its best in the creative group lifts which appear both aquatic and ethereal at the same time. Thom Weaver’s dusky lighting creates a mid-night, soporific mood. Another New York premiere, The Ballad (2022), follows. It was created in collaboration with Darlene Kascak of the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation. Kascak is the Education Director & Traditional Native American Storyteller of The Institute of American Indian Studies in Washington, CT. The piece grew out of a longer work, Bloom, created during the pandemic and performed in a forest. Though the piece has been shortened and moved indoors, it retains an outdoor feel with the help of Brian Tovar’s lighting, Yannick Godts’ props, and Valerie St. Pierre Smith’s costumes. The soundscape, created by Ben Sollee, weaves together Kascak’s stories of her own life with those of Sky Woman Falling and the Wendigo. Marlon Feliz’s performance is especially soulful. The program ends with Branches (2017), another piece that was originally performed outdoors (this time at Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival’s Inside/Out Series). The sextet is so fun. The dancers prove once again that they are something more than human. This time they are frogs, then birds. Exquisite creatures. Liz Prince’s bare-minimum costumes show off their powerful bodies, and Weaver’s lighting and David Van Tieghem’s sound design fully transport us to a rainforest. Program B This program begins with another fan favorite: On the Nature of Things (2014). Like the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius’s first-century BC poem of the same name, the trio examines the creation myth, divine intervention, and the very human fear of death and eternal oblivion. From the beginning, when Buchsbaum lays Feliz on a pedestal/altar/pillar and Quincy Ellis (the Company’s other Dance Captain) slithers over, it’s clear that something Adam and Eve-y is going on. The dancers spend most of the piece sharing the three-foot-wide pillar, slowly intertwining in poses and logic-defying lifts that hearken to ancient Greek bas-reliefs and Renaissance paintings, their bodies statuesque in Neil Peter Jampolis’ chiaroscuro lighting design. Vivaldi and mezzo-soprano Clare McNamara add a touch of the holy to the already exquisite performance. Next, Walklyndon (1971), another signature work created by the founding members, offers some much-needed comic relief. There is no music, just the sound of footsteps and the occasional grunt or vocalization as the six dancers bump into each other while walking across the stage. The movements are pedestrian, theatrical, and earthy. Kitty Daly’s costumes—yellow unitards and bright gym shorts—add to the absurdity of the scene. It is simply silly, and my cheeks hurt afterward from laughing. The third New York premiere, Awaken Heart (2023), follows. The quartet, which Jaworski told me is “a reminder of the transience of life and friendships and relationships” and Kent describes it as being about “the way that souls bump into each other throughout different perhaps multiverses, lifetimes”, is lovely. The choreography made in collaboration with former Company dancer Gaspard Louis shifts between the fast-paced reality of relationships and the slow-motion nostalgia of memories. As always with Pilobolus, the lifts are top-notch. Michael Wall’s musical score is beautiful (The guy knows what he’s doing—he composes around 200 new commissions a year!) as is Diane Ferry Williams’ soft lighting. Zack Weiss gives a standout performance with his tender partnering and muscular grace. Untitled (1975) is another vintage Pilobolus delight created by its founding members. Feliz and Hannah Klinkman are charming in their long, rich gowns designed by Daly and Malcolm McCormick. The gowns are long enough to reach the floor even when the women stand on two of their fellow dancers’ shoulders, which they do for most of the piece while being courted by two regular-sized men. The result is surreal and hilarious, a circus act with all the first-date nerves. Another short and sweet piece that made my cheeks hurt from smiling is Behind the Shadows (2021), inspired by their iconic Shadowland (2009) and its original cast. It’s not often that I giggle during a performance at The Joyce, but when I saw the shadow of an elephant appear on the screen (thanks to Godts’ ingenious lighting) and then saw how it had been made with human bodies, I giggled. In David Poe’s song “Joy”, which plays throughout, he sings: “If it gives you joy, then you don’t have to explain it.” I agree. The program closes out with one more Company classic: Sweet Purgatory (1991). It is self-consciously dramatic—how can it not be when it’s set to music by Shostakovich?—and full of fluid, impeccable groupwork. The sextet is a showcase of the Company’s ability to trust and support each other and move as one organism, which this group does so well. So, which program should you see? Both! If that’s not possible: either. They are equally enjoyable and impressive, equally unforgettable. But first, let’s go back to Jaworski’s dream about her house being on fire. She is correct that, according to popular dream analysis, a house on fire is often a sign of anxiety. However, fire can also be a sign of transformation, purification, and renewal. It can symbolize a kind of awakening. And after seeing these performances, I believe there is a rebirth happening here. Not just for Jaworski, but for Pilobolus too, and for all of us who get to watch them do their thing.

      "title": "Sam Bankman-Fried Goes to Jail, Back to School With A.I. and A Self-Driving Car Update",
      "text": "It’s funny, if you go to the top podcasts on Spotify, most days, it’s, like, mixture of, like, Joe Rogan and his friends. But then it’s like sleep podcasts. Have you have seen these ones? You’re right, we are now below relaxing white noise. [LAUGHS] It’s unfortunate. They’ve had some really good guests recently. They’ve had some great guests. [LAUGHS]:: Should we do some white noise to open the show today, just for anyone who’s having trouble falling asleep and may use “Hard Fork” as a sleep aid? Mm-hmm. OK. Ready? OK. [MIMICS WHITE NOISE] [MUSIC PLAYING] And then can you just loop that for 40 minutes? [LAUGHS] Perfect. Podcast done. I’m Kevin Roose. I’m a tech columnist at “The New York Times.” I’m Casey Newton from Platformer. And you’re listening to “Hard Fork.” This week on the show, Sam Bankman-Fried goes to jail. We’ll tell you why and what’s next. Then, we go back to school with Wharton professor, Ethan Malek, who tells us what teachers and students need to know about this year in AI. And finally, another wild week in the world of robotaxis, what happened, and what you told us about our autonomous vehicle episode last week. Casey, you know on this show, we love to talk about Sam Bankman-Fried. We do. And you know what he’s having this week? What? I mean, look, I’ve had a bad month. Another one? Yeah. [LAUGHS] Guy’s been through a bit of a rough patch. So, Sam Bankman-Fried is having one of the worst weeks of a string of very bad weeks. Because this week, he went to jail. And here to talk with us about how that happened, what is going on in the ongoing saga of FTX is my colleague and friend of the pod, David Jaffe Bellini. David, welcome to “Hard Fork.” Thanks for having me. Hi, David. So it has been a very active few weeks in the case of Sam Bankman-Fried. Sam Bankman-Fried, of course, is the former CEO of FTX, the crypto exchange that collapsed late last year after allegedly misusing a bunch of customer funds. You reported this week that Sam Bankman-Fried went to jail because a federal judge in New York had revoked his bail. So just catch us up on why Sam Bankman-Fried is sitting in a jail cell in New York now and not at his parents’ home in California, where he’s been. So, yeah, the important context here is that, basically, from the moment that SBF was released into home confinement, he’s been pushing the boundaries of what you’re allowed to do when you’re out on bail. So first, in January, he sends an email and a message to a former FTX employee, basically saying, hey, let’s talk. Let’s, you know, see if we can get on the same page about a few things. The prosecutors were really unhappy about that. They said this kind of reeked of potential witness tampering, that this was somebody who might testify in the case against Sam Bankman-Fried, and that, therefore, this was totally improper. Then while the negotiations over whether to tighten his bail terms as a result of that were going on, he was caught using a VPN to access the internet, which the prosecutor said was a sign that he was trying to kind of evade detection in his online activities. So that was sort of the context of what led up to the last couple of weeks. And can I just do a sort of a clarifying aside here? When you are arrested and you get out on bail, whether you are a white collar, very wealthy defendant, like Sam Bankman-Fried, or someone who is not wealthy, or powerful, or the former CEO of a company, you have some conditions, right? The judge says, I will let you out on bail, but you have to, in some cases, pay some money or put up some collateral. And you can’t commit any more crimes. And there are certain conditions for you remaining free on bail. And in this case, my assumption is that because Sam Bankman-Fried was so online, for lack of a better word, he was signaling people and playing video games, the one of the things that the judge had said was that in order to remain free on bail, you actually can’t do any of that stuff. Is that correct? That’s essentially what happened. I mean, it came from this sort of interesting contradiction, which is that his original bail terms said you have to stay in your parents’ house, and you have to wear an ankle monitor. So physically, he was confined. But in the world of cyberspace, he could kind of roam free and do whatever he wanted. And most criminal defendants would just stay quiet, try not to upset anybody while they’re awaiting trial. But Sam’s not a normal criminal defendant. And he was signaling people. He was Tweeting. He was writing Substack posts. And this was clearly really ticking off the prosecutors and ticking off the judge too. And so what ended up happening is that a whole new set of bail terms were imposed on him that limited which websites he could access. So there’s actually — there was a list of maybe 25 or so websites that he was allowed to access, including nytimes.com, of course. And that was what he was confined to doing. And he was also prevented from reaching out to people who were involved in the case, like former employees who might be involved in the trial. And so those were the limitations on him starting around last spring. Now, when I hear that I would have to live in my parents’ house and could only visit 25 websites, that sounds like a cruel and unusual punishment to me. But that’s apparently not the case here? Well, it’s. a better alternative than sitting in jail. I think most people would agree. Though, maybe you don’t, Casey. I don’t know what your relationship — Here’s what I’ll say. I either want to have all of the internet or none of the internet. If you give me, like, 1 percent of the internet, that’s going to give me an aneurysm. I’m also not sure if Platformer was on the list, no offense. And by the way, my lawyers are looking into this. My favorite detail from your reporting on this bail violation is that he was apparently using a VPN to watch a football game. Is that correct? That is true, or at least that’s what his defense has claimed. I mean, the prosecution sort of cited the fact that he’d used VPNs on certain dates as evidence of potentially nefarious activity. And the defense came back and said, no, that was the date of the Conference Championships in the NFL. and then the Super Bowl. And he was just trying to watch football. The reason he needed a VPN is because as he’d gotten an international NFL streaming account when he lived in the Bahamas. And he needed to access it from his home in the US. If I was out on bail and one of my conditions of my bail was that I not use a VPN, maybe that’s one where you just skip the game and catch it on SportsCenter, THAT’S an option too, Maybe you just read the post-game report at nytimes.com, one of your approved websites. [LAUGHS]: Right. So one of the most interesting and controversial wrinkles in this latest twist in the SBF case involves a story that you published actually in late July, that was about, basically, the diary of Caroline Ellison, who ran the Alameda hedge fund and was also SBF’s ex-girlfriend. And this was a story that reported on the existence of these Google Docs that Caroline Ellison had written about her stress and anxiety running this hedge fund and some details of the relationship between her and SBF. This story came out and then was subsequently cited by prosecutors as evidence that Sam Bankman-Fried had violated the terms of his bail in talking with the media. So, David, what can you tell us about this wrinkle in the case and this diary of Caroline Ellison’s? We did a story a few months ago noting that people involved in the case had a handwritten diary that Caroline had kept and that she had also kind of recorded her feelings and thoughts about various things on Google Documents. So we’d known that for a while. And then this more recent story that we did actually had detailed excerpts from the Google Documents that she had written. And this included accounts of her kind of insecurity about her position running Alameda. Was she a good enough leader? Was she really suited to doing this type of job, sort of reflected a lot of the stress that she was feeling throughout the year. And it also got into some sort of intimate details of her romantic relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried. They had a kind of on and off relationship. And so reflections on what it was like to be around him after they broke up and that sort of thing. And all of this is potentially relevant to the case because their relationship is at the heart of the relationship between these two companies. She’s agreed to testify against him at trial. So any kind of insight into what she’s thinking and feeling is helpful, and interesting, and sort of sheds new light on the case. So that’s the sort of background on her writings and what was in them. And prosecutors have said that Sam Bankman-Fried leaked these documents to the “New York Times.” And that was apparently part of the judge’s decision to revoke his bail and send him to jail. So what can you tell us about that? Sure. So within 24 hours of our story coming out, the prosecutors submitted a filing that basically said, we’ve confirmed with Sam’s lawyers, they’ve admitted to us that Sam was a source for documents that were used in this story. And therefore, we want to put a gag order on him. We want to stop him from talking. He’s already limited in what websites he can access. But we want to prevent him from talking to the media because this is a sort of improper intervention in the case that could sort of interfere with a fair trial, intimidate witnesses, that sort of thing. So that was kind of their first salvo. So help me understand this because I’m a little confused here. Because on one hand, you have prosecutors who are saying that Sam Bankman-Fried leaked these documents from Caroline Ellison to the media in order to engage in kind of character assassination, or witness tampering, or make her look bad ahead of her potential testimony at this trial this fall. And I read the story that you wrote. I read the excerpts from these writings. They were kind of embarrassing, in the same way that many of our private writings would be embarrassing if they were leaked to “The New York Times.” But they didn’t strike me as particularly damning. She wasn’t saying, actually, Sam’s innocent and I did all the crimes. So if prosecutors are correct in alleging that he did leak these diaries, why do you think he did that. Was there more to it than just trying to make her look bad? Yeah. So obviously I’m a little limited in what I can say because this involves confidential sourcing. But I can tell you what the prosecutors are claiming that he did and their rationale for why he did it. And what they’re saying is that these were very kind of sensitive writings, very personal, not the sort of thing that anybody would want to come out publicly and that the sort of prospect of similar material coming out regarding other witnesses could have this sort of effect of intimidation or cause people to back off. It could also have that effect on Caroline, they’re claiming, because she might think, oh maybe, Sam’s got other stuff, and I better be careful what I say at trial. That actually makes a lot of sense to me. It’s like, nice diary you got there. It’d be a shame if something happened to it. So Sam Bankman-Fried had his bail revoked and was subsequently put in jail. What do we know about the hearing where this was announced? Were you there in the room with us? Can you tell us a little bit more about what that was like? So unfortunately, I was not at either of the hearings that have happened on this issue because I’m stuck out here on the west coast. But I had colleagues at both hearings. So there was an initial hearing, which everyone thought was just about this gag order that the prosecutors were asking for. But the prosecution comes into the room and immediately changes tact. Seconds before the hearing starts, they tell the defense, we’re going to be asking for his bail to be revoked and for him to be sent to jail immediately. So there’s an initial hearing on that, where Sam’s lawyers basically say, we haven’t had any time to prepare. You need to give us some more time. And so the judge calls a second hearing a couple of weeks later. That was this past Friday. And at that hearing, there’s about an hour of argument, both sides kind making their case. The judge says, all things considered, I’m revoking bail. It’s not just because of this recent story. It’s because of the initial outreach to FTX employee. It’s partly this VPN thing, which the judge said kind of showed a mindset of trying to evade limitations. And basically, it was the last straw for the judge. All right, so that’s why SBF is in jail. You’ve also reported that there’s been a new filing by prosecutors in this case, detailing a bunch of new evidence against him. So tell us about what was in this filing and what that might mean for the trial. Yeah. So one of the things that was surprising about Sam’s bail getting revoked is we’re really in the home stretch before the trial. There’s not a lot of time left. Trial starts October 2nd. And we’re kind of in the final stage of pretrial wrangling in court, where both sides say, this is the evidence we’ve got and here’s why we think it should be admissible in court. And so there’s going to be arguments back and forth about that. And on Monday, the prosecution filed a long document, basically detailing, with way more color than we’ve ever seen before, what they’ve got and how they plan to use it. So they said, we’ve got these three close associates of SBF, including Caroline, who all pleaded guilty already. And we expect them to testify. And we’ve got contemporaneous notes that they kept after conversations with Sam. That includes some of Caroline’s writings, including a document titled things Sam is freaking out about. So I’ll look forward to learning more about that. So you haven’t seen it? We don’t know what Sam was freaking out about? I have not seen the thing Sam is freaking out about document. However, it did say in the filing on Monday that the list included things like the bad press around the connections between FTX and Alameda. So we have sort of a vague sense. But — By By the way, if it were me, something I would be freaking out about, using customer funds to fund my crypto empire. [LAUGHS]: But that would be things Casey was freaking out about. But go on. [LAUGHS]: Well, maybe that’s why you’re not the one in MDC right now. Not yet. Yeah, stay tuned. Anyway, so, yeah. So there are a bunch of other interesting things too. I mean, there’s text messages that another high-ranking FTX employee, named Ryan Salem, sent. He was the guy who donated tens of millions to Republican politicians. And prosecutors have kind of been circling him for a while. He hasn’t been charged. But he’s clearly going to come up, to some extent. There’s also an audio recording of a meeting that Caroline held with Alameda employees, right as the companies were collapsing last November, where she essentially confessed and said, I worked with Gary and Nishad, the two other executives that pleaded guilty, and with Sam and. Sam decided that we were going to take customer funds. She said that pretty explicitly. The fact that meeting happened, we’ve known for a long time. I reported it back then, as did others. But the prosecution has a full recording of it, with a transcript that was included in this filing. Who recorded it? I would’ve recorded it, Was someone wearing a wire? I mean, just — Even you would’ve recorded — any of us would have recorded this — you want to have that for the historical record. It seems like everything at this firm was being recorded and put into Google Documents, and voice memos, and whatnot. Well that’s the funny thing is that they actually didn’t do any record keeping for many, many of the important things that they should. But when it came down to writing down the crimes, they were all over it. Yeah, it was an Alameda employee who recorded it, apparently. I mean, this was a staff meeting. The staff was pretty small, but there were enough people in the room that someone got the voice memos out, presumably. And so, yeah, I mean, that was a — it was a pretty damning bit of evidence when it kind of first emerged that she said these things at the meeting back in November when we were all writing about it. And now that they’re planning to play that recording in court, it doesn’t look great for Sam. So in one of your stories, there was a line that said that, so far, there have been millions of pages of evidence produced. . I don’t think you were being figurative. Are there literally millions of pages of documents? And if so, what is in those millions of pages? And how can one man’s lawyers go through all of that? And please describe all million. Yeah. [LAUGHS]: There literally are millions of pages. But it’s, like, at some point, the prosecution subpoenaed the whole contents of SBF’s personal Google Drive from Google. So that’s however many hundreds of thousands of pages. And all the documentation that any of the key people in this case ever had on their computers is in play, their financial documents, spreadsheets, text message histories, Slack histories. They’ve got some Signal chats, I think. Though, the fact that SBF was on autodelete and advised employees to go on autodelete has been a factor in the case as well. So there could’ve been even more, potentially. And, yeah, it’s just a ton of stuff. Look, I know it is in the nature of federal prosecutors to just drown people in charges in hopes that they will reach a plea agreement and just end the whole thing without forcing a trial. And yet, that, in combination with all of the evidence that you’ve been describing for us, David, makes me wonder, why hasn’t Sam Bankman-Fried pled guilty? Any thoughts on that? I mean, look, it’s hard to read his mind on this. And of course, I think probably — and this is all speculation — but one thing the prosecutors might be hoping is that by forcing him to spend a little time in jail, they might change his thinking about this. But all the evidence suggests that he’s convinced that he has a chance of winning at trial and of waiting any prison time. And if you believe that, then our system allows you to fight the charges, as it should. And so we’ll see what comes of it. I mean, at various points throughout this process, people have pointed out that he seemed deluded about things. He thought that he could save the company in the days before he was arrested, that he could just raise new money and make the hole disappear. And it could be that some of that optimism is playing into his thinking now. Yeah, sometimes when you have these very high-profile trials, the defendant becomes a kind of cause celeb. And perhaps they have a fan base that rallies to their side and sort of lobbies in the court of public opinion, in the hopes that might change the outcome. Is there an SBF Fandom or constituency left? Are there folks out there saying, this guy’s getting a raw deal? Not really. A lot of people have made up their mind about him. This is something that has sort of come up a little bit in the back and forth over the story we did on Caroline, where SBF’s lawyers have argued that one of the reasons that he wanted to provide these documents was because he felt like he’s been unfairly maligned and that he should have a right to defend his reputation. And that’s partly because, yeah, like, there really isn’t a pro-SBF contingent out there arguing for his innocence. I mean, Crypto Twitter has certainly made up its mind that he’s the worst villain in the history of the world and that he should be drawn and quartered, essentially. And I think most mainstream legal analysts are pretty convinced that he’s guilty as well. So this is shaping up to be quite a trial in October. I imagine that you will be there, as will some of our other colleagues. What are you — This is shaping up to be quite a trial in the way that the Harlem Globetrotters’ next match is shaping up to be quite a basketball game. It’s not looking good for the Washington Generals this time. I didn’t say it was going to be a close trial. I just said it was going to be quite a trial. So what are you looking for or what are you most interested to see in the lead up to this trial? Well, one thing I would say, just to caution you on the Harlem Globetrotters comparison, you never know. I mean, this is why we have the system that we do. It only takes one juror to swing the outcome. And the prosecution has made a lot of claims about Sam. But they’ve been sort of claims that haven’t been fully, kind of, out and tested. And so that’s what we’ll see in court in October. And it should be incredibly interesting. But what am I watching for? I mean, look, it’s — I mean, there’s just the inherent drama of seeing three People as top advisors at his company, who were not just as top advisors. One was his girlfriend. The two others were two of his closest friends, who lived with him, who had been by his side for years. And that group testifying against him, there’s a certain — there’s a drama in that that’s pretty undeniable and that will be kind of fascinating to see play out. I mean, also, for someone like me who’s been obsessed with this case for almost a year and following every twist and turn, any new revelation of some new detail and some document that Caroline had that we didn’t know about is kind of thrilling as well. But it’s also a test of can this crackdown that the US government is doing on the crypto industry actually yield results? So that’s probably the more kind of important thing. Yeah, I am looking forward to that moment when they all testify against him, though. Because I think a very relatable feeling is wanting to see your boss go to prison. And those three are actually going to get to live that out. Well, Casey, would you flip on Kevin if it turned out that he was embezzling money from Hard Fork or something? I would. I’ve told Kevin, buddy, you better be walking the straight and narrow. Because when the cops come knocking at my door, let’s just say, I have a few Google Docs of my own, OK? Yeah, David, last question, if I were in possession of a recording of a secret meeting at which a podcast host and newsletter writer confessed to certain federal crimes, do you know any reporters I could send that to? Yeah, hit me up on Signal and we can discuss it. Oh. OK. We’ll just autodelete our conversation afterward. [LAUGHS]: [MUSIC PLAYING] David Jaffe Bellini, thanks so much for coming back. Thank you, David. Thanks for having me, anytime. When we come back, we’re going back to school with AI. Casey, it’s mid-August. And you know what that means. What does it mean, Kevin? It’s back to school time, baby. Oh my God, Kevin, I haven’t done the assigned reading. [LAUGHS]: What happens at the end of “Old Yeller“? Nothing good. Oh, no. So this year, one of the biggest questions facing schools as they reopen for the fall semester is what the heck do we do about generative AI? I think this is one of the biggest questions that schools have been wrestling with over the past year. ChatGPT, it came out, like, the semester was already underway. It sort of landed as kind of an asteroid out of the sky. And schools really just sort of scrambled to get through the year. And I really thought that this summer was going to be when schools and universities kind of regrouped and put their heads together and figured out, how do we actually educate people in a world where this generative AI stuff exists? What does homework look like? What does admissions look like? What is the role of the faculty member anymore? And that just seems not to have happened in any big, organized way. A lot of schools are still having meetings and organizing committees and task forces to try to figure out what to do about generative AI. And it just seems like there’s an area where there are a lot more questions than answers. Sure. And at the same time, I think that that might be OK. The technology is new. We don’t totally know what we ought to do about it. And so I think a world where different teachers are taking different approaches and schools are being a little slow in how they craft policies might be to everyone’s ultimate benefit. Right. But I do think this is an urgent issue for schools, especially going into this new school year. And so I wanted to kind of spend some time talking about that. And I wanted to talk to someone who actually does have a clear vision of how AI can and should transform education. And one person who stood out to me was Ethan Mollick Ethan is an associate professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He teaches innovation and entrepreneurship and also writes and thinks a lot about generative AI in the classroom. And he’s been sort of documenting his experiments with AI. He has a Substack called One Useful Thing. And he has actually come up with a strategy that he thinks could help other schools adapt to the post-ChatGPT world. And so I wanted to bring him on today to talk about how schools should be thinking about generative AI and what they should be doing about it. All right, let’s hear what he has to say. Ethan Mollick, welcome to “Hard Fork.” Thanks for having me. So I first came across your work last year when you and I were both writing a lot about generative AI. And you have sort of become, like, I would say, an AI guru inside the world of higher education. I know you’ve been talking with a lot of faculty members and administrators at schools across the country, who, it’s fair to say, I think are confused and disoriented about what to do about all of this new technology. So I want to just start with kind of a vibe check. Can you just paint a picture for us of what is going on with generative AI at schools right now as we head into the fall semester? I think the word I would probably use would be chaos or apocalypse. [CHUCKLING] I think that people are just starting to dawn on them what this means. And I think when we talk about what this means, I think level one of what this means is what’s dawning on them right now, which is, oh God, all my homework assignments don’t work anymore. And people haven’t started to think about the other implications fully yet. There’s a lot of exceptions out there. But generally, that’s the vibe I’m getting. Now, this technology has been available since last November. So what has happened between November and now where some other folks in higher ed or maybe secondary ed still aren’t thinking about this? So I think, for one thing, I think ChatGPT, the free version, GPT 3.5, still made enough kind of mistakes that it made it a little bit easier to ignore. I think the second set of things was that people are used to ignoring technology hype. So usually, hype happens five years before a technology comes out. So everyone talks about Web3, and you could just safely sit back and be a late adopter. I don’t think people realized this was hype for a technology that already hit, which is a little bit unusual. And people have had to catch up to that. And then I think the third thing is enough alarm at the institutional level inside organizations that people who’ve ignored this have had to pay attention. So between all of those things, I think it’s kind of created this bubble of anxiety and expectation. Right. Now, one thing we should say is that if you’re a teacher, something you can relax about is Web3. You can actually continue to ignore that one. But the AI stuff, you should probably pay attention to. [LAUGHS]: Right. Well, and I think there’s also this additional layer in education of, like, well, these tech companies have been showing up for decades now and telling us that their tools are going to transform the way we teach in the classroom, and these Chromebooks, and personalized learning software. And a lot of that has just been sort of empty hype. And so I think there was a reluctance on a lot of administrators’ parts to just take this stuff seriously. But you are in conversations pretty regularly, I think, with people at universities who are trying to figure out what to do beyond that first level, beyond the, like, how do we stop students from cheating on their homework level? And I want to talk about that. But first I want to talk about the level one concern, which is can schools actually stop students from cheating with a generative AI software? No. I mean, that’s sort of nuance. So the short answer is no. The long answer is AI uses undetectable, and it detects people who don’t speak English very well. It’s terrible. So you can’t use detectors. You can’t ask AI to detect AI. It’s just going to lie to you. Every instinct we have about how to stop plagiarism doesn’t work. So you can change how you teach. You could do Blue Book assignments. You could have people do oral exams. There are other ways of checking. But the old homework assignment is basically cracked by AI. I wonder if you could just take us inside one of these faculty meetings, where professors and school administrators are trying to figure out how to adapt to the post-ChatGPT world. What are some of the common things that you hear brought up in this world? And what are some of the common objections to why shouldn’t we be changing our policies and procedures? So the first thing is the same problem everybody is suffering from with generative AI, which is there’s no instruction manual. We’re all figuring it out as we go. There’s literally papers coming out regularly about what kind of questions should you ask AI to get the best answers? We don’t know whether it’s really good at these tests or whether it’s faking being good at these tests. So you come to a faculty meeting, and the first 20 minutes are debunking rumors and then supporting others about how it learns, and what it knows, and is it stealing information, and what’s ethical? So there’s a lot of that kind of discussion you’d expect among academics. Then, there is sort of a discussion about, how do you — usually a punitive discussion about stopping plagiarism. And then there is the sort of more advanced discussion about what do we do now? What do we tell our students? What is good instructional design look like? And I think that’s the more profitable part of the conversation. But you have to get through the fact that nobody knows anything, including, I would hate to say all of us in the room. We’re still kind of making it up and learning by experience and trying to tell other people based on that experience, which is quite challenging. So, OK, let’s talk about not just why schools are tying themselves up in knots about this, but what they should actually do. So you, me, and Casey are starting a university tomorrow, Hard Fork University. It’s a great school. Not accredited, but a great school. [LAUGHS]: And we get to craft the policy about generative AI and how it should be used. And we not only get to craft the policy, but we get to tell every instructor how to teach their class using this stuff in the best way possible. How would you run a school if you could make all the decisions about generative AI? So the cool thing about education is we’re in for a couple rough years, but actually kind of have a sense of what the future looks like. Because we actually have a lot of research on how to teach. And it happens to align really well with AI. And the secret is pretty simple. It’s two concepts, called The Flipped Classroom and Active Learning. So the idea of a flipped classroom is rather than learning the material inside of class and practice it outside of class, you learn the material outside of class and practice it inside. So the basic version that you might have seen is people watching videos of a math lecture or Caud Academy outside of class. And then in class, you work on problem sets together. When you have trouble, the teacher comes around and helps. Some people present to the class about that. It’s all about putting knowledge to use. It’s all about the challenging yourself, pushing yourself into an active learning environment. So it flips the classroom experience, where, instead of focusing on lecturing inside a class and doing assignments outside, you do the reverse. We’ve known this is a really great way to teach for a long time. But the two problems have been, what do we do in a flipped classroom setting? Do we just give people textbooks to read? Do they watch videos? That’s never worked particularly well. Now we have AI tutors that will be able to fill in some of that basic instructional piece. And then in class, how do we design enough engaging experiences for people? Well, it turns out AI is really good at helping us to create engaging experiences. So I actually think the classroom of the future looks remarkably like the classroom today, but you reverse what you’re doing in it. And I think we could get a lot of the way there. Tell us what an engaging experience designed by an AI looks like. Because I don’t know that I would say I’ve had a lot of engaging experiences interacting with the bot so far. So I don’t think it’s about engaging experience with the bot. I think that it is about putting knowledge to use. The AI is remarkably good about taking theory and giving you practice from it. So if you say I want to have an in-class activity for fifth graders to teach about entropy — and I’ve actually done this — it came up with a really cool idea of an in-class entropy activity involving balls and people standing still and running around. And it actually tied really nicely into entropy. And then it suggested a good classroom discussion. And then it actually built a game and coded the whole game for me that students could play with that activity. Now, I would want teachers to have input into that. But that’s an active way of learning about a material that you learned outside of class and putting it to use in class and checking whether people understand the behavior, having people discuss it, having people act on it. So it’s not about engaging with the AI. It’s about having the AI help you figure out ways as an instructor to engage with the students. Yeah. Now, you have been using generative AI in your classrooms at Wharton since ChatGPT came out last year. What are some findings from that experience that might help other professors who are thinking about how to use this stuff in their classes? And I was actually using it a little bit before. So I was impressed enough by GPT 3, which sort of wrote like a fifth grader, to have an assignment to sort of show them a future where they had to cheat with AI. And it was very funny because halfway through the cheating assignment, when half the students had turned it in, GPT 3.5 came out and it definitely changed the game there. So I have all kinds of things that I have people do. I make AI mandatory. I teach an entrepreneurship class. So it’s a little easier for me. If I was teaching English Composition, I would probably be thinking a lot more about how do I do more in-class work, where people are writing in Blue Books because you still need to learn to write and practice. And I can’t flip the classroom. that way. But in terms of my classes, it’s been great. I actually literally require people to do at least one impossible assignment, that’s in the syllabus now. So if you can’t code — What does that mean? — so if you can’t code, you have to write working software. If you’ve never done design work, I expect a fully built-out graphic design product. It is literally you have to do something that you think you cannot do. Every assignment has to be critiqued by at least three famous entrepreneurs through history. And that might sound like fun because it teaches them how the AI works. But it also is important because one of the defining characteristics of entrepreneurship is hubris. And it is actually one of the number one predictors of entrepreneurial entry. And so things that break your hubris are actually quite useful. And the easiest way to do that is to have strong perspectives that do that. So it’s let me increase the amount of work people do. It’s let me push the kind of assignments they do. It’s let me help you adjust in a lot of ways. So AI mandatory works very well for the kind of classes I teach. And we should say, that when you say that you’re having your students talk with great entrepreneurs through history, they are not actually speaking with the dead. They are going to the chat bot and say, sort of critique this in the voice of Steve Jobs or something like that, right? Exactly. And it’s one of several kinds of prompts that I give them. So I give them tutor prompts. Because otherwise, they ask the AI to explain something to them like they’re 10. And that’s fine, but that’s not actually how good teaching works. The way good teaching works is you solicit explanations from people and you critique the explanations. You don’t explain things to them and ask if they get it. So I give them prompts that we’ve created that actually do that kind of interaction. And I give them prompts that act as a mentor, and help them with classroom problems, and give them prompts that they can use for their teams to help do actual good team activity. So there is this kind of interesting role where I’m designing material that then interacts with them like a TA or a really good research assistant. In your experience, has the introduction of generative AI into your classroom kind of changed the culture of your classroom at all? I mean, I was recalling an episode that my colleagues at The daily did earlier this year about basically, ChatGPT in education. And they interviewed a professor who said that, basically, since ChatGPT came out, his whole attitude toward his students had changed. Where it used to be that when he saw a surprising and skilled piece of student writing, he was delighted. It was like a cause for celebration. And now, when he sees something that feels maybe a little too good for the student’s ability level, he gets suspicious, and defensive, and starts sort of saying, well, did they cheat on this using ChatGPT? It just seems to have changed the teacher-student relationship, in that case. Are you finding that at all? Or maybe are students participating less in class because they know they can go ask a chat bot for clarification on something after they get back to their room? Or how has the culture of your classroom changed? I mean, it broke the old-style culture, right? So I’m on the edge of a new technology. So I’m excited about that. I can understand why that’s worrying. People don’t raise their hands as much. Because one of the things we trust people to do in the classroom was show ignorance so we can explain things to them. Now it’s much better to not show ignorance in front of 80 people. You’ll ask the chatbot later about how to answer the question. It means that people always cheat. It’s not a new thing. There’s 20,000 people, at least prior to November, in Kenya whose job was writing essays for people. This is not a new phenomenon. But now it’s much more obvious. Wait, what is this? Is this, like, a comp — what is this company? Oh, no, it’s not a single company. There’s a paper that shows that estimates the number of people who are getting jobs writing essays, mostly for college students. That’s amazing. Yeah. It’s pretty incredible. And so cheating was pretty ubiquitous. It actually has been fascinating. Since the birth of the internet, the value of homework has dropped precipitously. I think cheating was already happening. We could ignore it. So this, again, another forcing issue, It forces us to grapple with actual changes that have already been happening in classroom environments and that we didn’t have to worry about before. So it has changed the attitude. I would say that that suspicion of writing is probably right. But I also no longer accept badly written stuff in my classes. Why would I? And for every student that was a brilliant writer before, I had 18 students who were not brilliant writers. And some of them, English was their seventh language. Why should I expect them to write a beautiful essay and punish them or not based on their prose? So it does change things. We haven’t figured it all out yet. But it is some positive is along with the negative. Well, and I sort of want to pause on that because that’s a very interesting point. What you’re saying is that you used to get essays from kids that weren’t particularly well written. And you kind of give them a pass, based on their individual circumstances. But now there is a tool that will instantly improve the quality of their prose. And so you just expect that they will use it. And to not do that is bad form. Well, not just that. I expect them to use it well. And so it turns out, a little bit of prompting knowledge goes a long way. And I require at least five prompts for everything they turn in. And they have to give me a paragraph reflection on the prompt. And if they want to use the AI for the paragraph reflection, they can. Then they have to tell me the prompts and reflect on that paragraph. But it’s hard to cheat on that piece. So the result is I want the writing to be different. It has to reflect their own writing. If it has that ChatGPT style, where it says, and then in conclusion, I’m like, oh, come on you didn’t even cheat well. Now, you mentioned earlier that part of the reason you’ve been able to run all these experiments in your classes is because you teach entrepreneurship, which is sort of adjacent to AI, in many ways. And you also have a very personal interest and affinity for this technology. What do you say to 20-year English professor, or the organic chemistry professor, or the anthropologist who says I actually don’t want to make my class all about AI. I want to teach. And I want my students to learn. And I want them to show me their work, even if it’s imperfect and know that that reflects what’s actually going on in their head and not some chat bot somewhere? What do you say to the professor who just says, you know, I don’t really want to turn my classroom into an AI lab? And I think that’s a huge number of people. And it makes complete sense. I think that stage one is recognizing that your homework broke. And that means that you may have to flip classrooms. You may have to hold people accountable with in-class exams, with having the Wi-Fi turned off, your Chromebook in demo mode. There are ways of solving this problem in the short term. I think the bigger, longer-term problem is what does this all mean? What does this change about education? Now, I would actually argue, in some ways, I think the only thing that carries us forward is expertise. And building expertise actually requires a lot of tedious fact learning and other material to get started. So I think that we’re going to be able to justify some of these returns. But I think in the short term, it’s acknowledging this thing is real and then providing subguidance that, hey, I’ve been running all of our assignments through AI. Here’s the things it gets right and wrong. So just as you start to do it, you should recognize that it will give you wrong answers on these kind of chemistry problems. And then you flip the classroom a little bit. And I think you could be OK in the short term. Right. We’ve talked a lot about how teachers and professors should be thinking and feeling about generative AI in the classroom. What about students? I mean, students, millions of them, are going back to school right now for the fall semester. I’m sure many of them have already been playing around with this stuff. But now they’re confronting policies and restrictions. How should students be treating generative AI. I would demand clarity. I would demand clarity for what this means that AI is banned or acknowledged. Does this mean that I’m allowed to use AI to generate ideas? Could AI come with an outline that I work on? Can I ask for feedback from AI in my work. Because getting feedback’s incredibly useful. And it’s very good at providing feedback along the way. Am I allowed to use AI as a teammate? Can I ask the AI advice for something? Can I ask to explain why I got a question right or wrong? I think there is a request for clarity that’s useful. And I also think that the future AI that our students are going to graduate into is going to look very different than AI today. So I think the idea that we’re teaching kids how to use AI is actually not that useful in and of itself. It’s going to be much more self-prompting. It’s going to take away parts of work that we used to do before. So I think you are allowed as a student to ask for what does this mean, while being patient with your teachers that they haven’t figured it out either. Nobody knows the answer. I’m curious, Ethan, one thing I hear a lot from educators when it comes to generative AI is this worry that it kind of flattens student creativity, and output, and effort, that when everyone is a B-plus writer and it’s sort of producing kind of generic prose, that it kind of sounds a little bit like Wikipedia, almost. It’s like you sort of sand down some of the edges of one student having a very different writing style or another student communicating in a very different way. So I think there are a lot of worries not just about what this is going to do to the classroom experience, but actually what it’s going to do to the minds of students who are relying on this technology to help them think, and write, and work. Do you share any of that worry? Or what are some of your worries about the long-term effects of generative AI on students? I think we’re going to lose a lot. And I think we’re going to need to figure out how to reconstruct that. I certainly think in the short term, flattening is real. Another phenomenon that falling asleep at the wheel is real. We have papers showing that people will tend to — when they use AI that’s very good, they tend to not pay enough attention anymore and kind disengage from the work itself. That’s a real phenomenon. I mean, essays were useful. It’s a shame to lose them as a homework assignment. Things are going to be lost. And I think some of this flattening effect is very true. So we need to teach people how to write with their own voice, while still being able to use AI. And I think that you’ve probably found is users, you can make AI do much more interesting things if you don’t just do a generic prompt. The first prompt is always Wikipedia-style perfect English. But you can get it to do some kind of neat things with some time. But I think it’s part of that bigger issue. By the time we have students in high school today, we have six or seven years before they’re in the workforce, for those who are going to college. And so what does that mean for a moving target for the future is a bigger question. It does outsource some of our thinking and some of our abilities, in a way that people were worried about with Google also and other phenomenon. It’s true, and yet, I do want to say, as somebody who wrote essays in college at one point, a good number of those essays were written between the hours of, let’s say, 3:00 and 9:00 AM the morning they were due, while I was hopped up on No Doze pills. And I’m not sure how much I learned during the — now, on the whole, yes, essay writing was a huge part of my education. But not every student puts everything they have into every writing assignment. Absolutely. And I also want to apologize, the TA in my English Literature course in college, they took pass/fail and never revealed to them it was pass/fail. So I could get solid C’s. And every time, they’d write these elaborate notes and apologize to me for giving me a bad grade. I’d be like, I wrote that in 25 minutes. So I totally get that. And I think that’s another piece, is we have to not be delusional about what has actually happened in education. And to go back to the issue, that’s what I hope the gift of the AI piece is, less the AI itself than this act of being deliberate at what we reconstruct at Hard Fork University of what parts of education matter? And we actually a lot about that. And we to figure out how to reconstruct those pieces. So back to Hard Fork. University, our University that the three of us are starting. Which, by the way, was recently voted to have the worst football team in the entire country country. But the parties are amazing. Should we have an admissions essay? I mean, is that also one of the things that is on its way out? Oh, absolutely. That’s done for. I have been enjoying having it — if you have not had the experience of asking it to write admissions essays, justification, it’s amazing at. So one of my recent favorites was, explain how stubbing my toe in the fourth grade taught me about adversity and why I want to be a neurosurgeon. And it was just amazing. It filled the details about how I realized about — that something as small as nerves could make such a difference in my life and that — and it was just, like, wow, this is great. I mean, a lot of stuff’s going to break. And so we have to decide what we’re doing, rather than fighting a fighting retreat against the AI, that as it takes thing after thing. We have to really rethink what we want to do with admissions and other policies. Well, I mean, what I would say is that have to have at least one TikTok go viral, if you want to compete in today’s economy. [LAUGHS]: So that’s what I would be looking for. It’s time to dance. OK, so we won’t have take-home essays and we won’t have assignments that students can easily plagiarize using ChatGPT. Are all of our assignments going to be in-class Blue Book essays? What other types of work will we assign at Hard Fork University? So I think we need to divide the kind of work that we want to do. Learning English composition for our English 101 on one course, that’s going to be a lot of maybe reading stuff, getting critical feedback outside of class, with a combination of AI help and human help. And then in class, you’ll be doing a lot of writing. It’s going to be writing workshops. That’s our intro courses. I’m hoping that as our classes get more advanced, you’re taking your two one levels, you’re taking more applied classes, that the in-class activities start to become very interesting. So the ability of students to get things done, to push past the frontiers that used to be a 101 frontier is fascinating. So we’re going to push the power of AI to get people to do more than before. They’re not just going to do basic stuff. They’re going to do advanced stuff. They’re going to be 10 times more productive by the time they get out of the program. Sounds compelling, sign me up. Last question, Ethan, what would it take to get you to leave your job at Wharton and join the faculty of Hard Fork University? So do you offer tenure? [LAUGHS]: We’re working on it. Unaccredited, untenured university, I feel like these are my colleagues who joined start up companies here. I’ve done that already. So I’m willing to be visiting faculty, though, if the location’s nice. It’s a dingy podcast studio for now, but we are going to be expanding to a beautiful campus soon. Not too late for the metaverse for this one. All right, Ethan Mollick, thank you so much for coming on. Thank you, Ethan. Thanks for having me. After the break, another wild week in the world of self-driving cars, and some thoughts from you, our listeners, on our interview from last week. Well, Kevin, if I learned one thing from last week’s episode, it is that people have strong opinions about autonomous vehicles. They really do. I would say that not before in the history of the show have we gotten as strong a reaction to an interview that we have done. It’s been really wild. I mean, we’ve gotten, like, so many emails, and DMs, and replies on social media about this episode. Thread, Skeets Instagram stories — [LAUGHS]: — we got it all, baby. I did not realize that this is the most polarizing issue in America. It really feels like we accidentally stumbled into a K-pop fan army. [LAUGHS] Yeah. And, look, I think we found our way into this story because there is this group, Safe Street Rebel, that is going around and they’re putting traffic cones on the hoods of autonomous vehicles, which has the effect of disabling them. And they’re trying to do that to draw attention to concerns they have around autonomous vehicles and cars in general. And we thought, well, that’s interesting. Let’s have a conversation with them about that. I think what we heard back from listeners, though, is that the issues here run deeper. And our listeners really wanted to get into it into much more detail on a bunch of subjects related to AVs. Yeah, it was a very polarizing segment. We got a lot of people saying, like, they loved the segment. We got a lot of people saying they hated the segment. We got people saying your guests were correct, and you guys are wrong, and you’re too pro AV and anti-transit. We also got people saying your guests did not make their points clearly and you should’ve picked someone better to make the case. So it was just kind of all over the map, but very, very strong feelings on all sides. So we want to talk about listener’s opinions about the segment because a lot of listeners raise some really great points. But first, a really extraordinary amount of news happened in the AV realm, including in San Francisco, just over the past seven days. And so we thought, let’s take a quick beat and just talk about what’s been going on. So the first thing that happened was we did manage to get it into last week’s episode. It happened just before we published the episode, which is that the CPUC, the agency in San Francisco that was voting on the fate of these pilot projects for driverless cars, voted to allow Cruise and Waymo to expand in San Francisco. They can now run these AVs 24/7 and charge money for them. And that’s a big deal, right? Huge deal. Because in order to hail one of these taxis before, you sort of had to have special access. You could only access it at night, primarily. But now, these are about to become just a fact of daily life in San Francisco in a way they were not before. Right, and these companies are now going to start expanding into many more cities. Cruise just announced it is starting to offer driverless rides in Charlotte, North Carolina. They’re also expanding to cities in Texas. So this is going to be coming to, if not a city near you, then at least a city within driving distance of you very soon. That’s right, but there’s another story we should talk about, which is that over the weekend, a group of 10 Cruise cars essentially came to a halt, blocking traffic in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco. Yeah, this was an amazing story. So right after this big vote by the CPUC, this pile up sort of happens in North Beach. And at first, it sounds like maybe it was related to this music festival, Outside Lands. That’s one of the big festivals in San Francisco. And at first, Cruise said, well, this was due to wireless connectivity issues. But then, as the week went on, it looks more and more like this was a case of pedestrian interference. And in fact, that’s the new explanation that Cruise has for why all these cars stopped in the middle of the street. What I love about these explanations is that neither one of them makes any sense to me. OK? [LAUGHS]: When it comes to wireless connectivity, these Cruise cars are miles away from the Outside Lands music festival. So I’m sure a lot of people were posting their Skeets and their Threads at Outside Lands. But I don’t understand how they were doing it in large enough volume to stop a car miles away. OK? Cruise eventually comes to the same conclusion. It says, oh, yeah, I guess it wasn’t wireless connectivity, which doesn’t exactly inspire a lot of confidence. But then they come up with explanation number two, which is pedestrian interference. And, Kevin, I would just like to ask you, what do you think pedestrian interference is? [LAUGHS] And but — Well, the company — How does it stop 10 cars from moving? Well, we don’t know, because Cruise has not said a ton more. And we don’t have the footage from the cars themselves. They have said, they told us that it was not a cone-related stoppage. This was not the fault of our organizer friends from last week — Let me tell you something. — that we know of. As a pedestrian, I have interfered with traffic. And here’s how I’ve done it. I’ve stepped in front of a car because I wanted to cross the street. And at most, this has affected one car. OK? I mean, maybe the car behind it has to slow down too. But when I interfere as a pedestrian, I’m stopping one car for five seconds. So I would just like to a lot more from Cruise about how this alleged pedestrian managed to stop 10 cars from moving for many minutes on end. Right. But whatever the reason for the traffic jam, I think it’s fair to say this was not one of the worst things that could happen in an autonomous vehicle. And it was actually cleared pretty quickly. In fact, it lasted only about 15 minutes. Well, I do think this is one of the worst things that could happen to our argument that autonomous vehicles are good. We’ve been trying to make the case. And then 10 of these things come to a dead standstill. And I found the whole thing very inconvenient. Yeah. I think if we thought we had road rage problems before this, we have not seen — if you’re angry at someone for driving too slowly, you’re going to be 10 times angrier if it’s a robot driving too slowly or coming to a stop in front of you. But, to my mind, the biggest story that has been published since we came out with our last episode was a story that ran in the “San Francisco Standard,” with the title, San Franciscans are having sex in robotaxis and nobody is talking about it. So this is a thing that I have been waiting to hear more about since these AVs launched, which was, you knew as soon as this happened that people are going to start having sex inside the robotaxis. And “The San Francisco Standard” interviewed four people who claim to have had sex inside cruise AVs, including one source who they called Alex, which is not his real name — [LAUGHS]: — who say claims to have performed at least six separate sex acts in robotaxis, ranging from impromptu makeout sessions to full-on sex, no boundaries activities — OK — — a total of three times in a Cruise car. First of all, are we considering a makeout session a sex act? [LAUGHS]: That seems a bit of a stretch to me. So I have questions about this. Also, wait, an impromptu makeout, as opposed to one that’s been scheduled and put on a Google Calendar? Oh, you don’t put all your makeout sessions on your Google Calendar. Hey, I like to keep it loose, baby. Anyways — So I have questions about this. All right. So we know that these cars have cameras inside them. Yes. Is some poor soul at Cruise headquarters just having to sift through hours of footage of horny people just climbing into these AVs and getting it on in the back seat? When we had the CEO of Cruise here, Kyle Vogt, we sort of asked him, isn’t there a high potential for bad behavior inside these cars? Shenanigans. Shenanigans, hijinks, antics, if you will, inside these cars. Because people — because there’s no Uber driver to sort of modulate people’s behavior. And he said, essentially just that, we have cameras in these cars. If anything gets out of control, we can look and see the cars. And it is amazing to me that San Franciscans are already saying, we don’t care, go ahead, look all you want. There’s a free show in the Cruise tonight. Yeah. I mean, there are lots of exhibitionists for whom the cameras are a feature, not a bug. I want to say — But I — — here’s my other logistical question about this. So when we rode in a Cruise car, as you’ll remember, it would not move unless both of us had our seatbelts on. It was very firm on this point. So presumably, these people who are having sex inside the robotaxis are doing it with their seatbelts on. And I just want to get your opinion on the logistics of that. How does that work? We have a saying in this community, safety first. OK? [LAUGHS]: If you want to have an impromptu makeout session in a car, you need to take care of your partner. And that means that you do need to keep your seat belt on. And, look, those seatbelts have a lot of give. OK? I don’t know about you, but I’ve been in a seat belt. I’ve reached all the way over to the other side of the car to grab something from THE driver’s side. So, yes, it’s absolutely possible, and it’s the way to do it. So that is the big news from the last week when it comes to autonomous vehicles. Now, let’s talk about some of the things our listeners are feeling in response to last week’s segment. Yeah. So i want to make some room to get some of the criticisms in here that we got. And, look, I’ll be the first to say, I’m not an expert on transit issues or autonomous vehicles issue. And part of what we do on this show is we just lead with our curiosity. We bring in people, we ask them questions. And, yeah, we express our opinions, but we’re open to other ideas. And so right now, we want to be open to our listeners’ ideas. Right. This is something that people care a lot about. And I want to respond to some of the notes we got about last week’s segment. And I think we should kind of sort it into a few flavors of criticism. The first one that we got a lot of responses on was basically listeners who were anti-self-driving car who were on the side of the organizers we interviewed, but who didn’t feel like they were the best ambassadors for that position or that we fully explored their point of view. And I think there was an element that I saw in a lot of the messages, both in email and social media. And it was basically that we didn’t engage with the real thrust of the activist argument, which is that we need fewer cars on the road, period. And of course, there’s a big tie-in between that idea and climate change, which I also think that readers think we were not taking that seriously enough. And if we were serious about climate change, we would want to be saying, yes, absolutely, get all these cars off the road. So, Kevin, what is your take on this idea that we need fewer cars on the road, period? Well, I think I share that view. I think car congestion and pollution are huge problems. And as anyone who has ever tried to drive around San Francisco can tell you, it would be a lot more pleasant here if there were, let’s say, 50 percent fewer cars on the roads. Now, I think there are some issues with that. Namely, there are just some people for whom cars are a sort of a necessary fact of life. We got a lot of notes from parents who said, I support transit, but there is no way that I could lug my kids and all of their stuff around on an e-bike or on the bus. Or what if you don’t live on a transit route? I got a note from somebody who said that cars are important if you have a disability. And they make life much easier for folks who may struggle to use transit if they have a disability. Totally. So I think there are a lot of people who just need cars or are attached to cars as their daily mode of transportation, for whom switching those people over to mass transit is just not going to be very practical. Yep. Now, that said, could I spend more time imagining a car-free future? Yeah, like I should. I grew up in America in the ‘80s and ‘90s. I’m extremely car pilled, and not by choice. It’s just kind of the oxygen that I’ve been breathing. But I can tell you, the reason I live in San Francisco and the reason I love it so much is because I can walk almost anywhere. And I walk basically wherever I can. I love taking transit. I got rid of my car. So in part, I really am trying to build this future. But we have a long way to go. Right. And the self-driving car companies would say that, actually, self-driving cars help to get cars off the road because we know from a study that was done about 10 years ago, that the typical car utilization is something, like, 5 percent. Which means that if you own a car, it sits there in your driveway or in a parking spot roughly 95 percent of the time. That is a horrible utilization rate. But with a driverless car system, that car can go pick up other people and take them where they need to go. You ",

      "title": "34 Elementary Icebreakers To Start The School Year Off Right - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "The start of the school year is a terrific time to get to know your students and encourage them to get to know one another. It is so important to foster a sense of community within your classroom to ensure it is an inclusive and welcoming space for all. Icebreakers for kids can help with getting to know each other, reinforcing important skills like listening and sharing, and, most importantly, having fun! Here are 34 of our favorite elementary icebreakers to start forming positive relationships and building community in your classroom. 1. The Book of Me Have your students create a book jacket cover and table of contents about themselves. Encourage them to come up with a clever title and embellish the front cover with an illustration that represents who they are. On the back cover, have them write a mini-biography like an “About the Author.” For the table of contents, have them name each chapter with something that is important to them, like their family, their hobbies, their favorite things, etc. 2. Who’s in Your Circles? Have your students draw three concentric circles on a blank piece of unlined paper. Choose a category (for instance, food, sports, TV shows, etc.) and have students write that word in the smallest center circle. In the adjacent circle, have them write “love,” and in the next circle out, write “like.” Have them write “don’t like” on the outside of the circle. Students will circulate and find a partner. They will ask each other to tell them one thing to fit into each circle (except the center) and write their classmates’ responses on their paper. For example, one sport they love, like, and don’t like. Once they’ve recorded each other’s answers, they mingle around and find another partner. The goal is to speak to as many classmates as they can in the allotted time. Change topics midway through if you’d like. Learn more: The Thinker Builder 3. Jigsaw Use a large piece of poster board to draw out a jigsaw puzzle with enough pieces for each student plus yourself. Cut out the pieces and give one to each student. Have each student decorate their piece with their name, words that describe them, and pictures. When everyone is finished, have each student share their puzzle piece and what it means. Then put the puzzle together on a bulletin board or blank wall. The finished puzzle will not only make a colorful display, it will represent how each student is part of the big picture of who your class is. 4. Spider Web Questions Gather students in a large circle. Take a ball of yarn and, holding tight to one end, toss the ball to one student. You can either ask them a question, such as “What is your favorite type of birthday cake?” or have students share one piece of information about themselves. Once they answer, they will hold on to a piece of yarn and toss the ball to another student. They will ask them a different question or the student will share something about themselves and so on. Once the ball has been tossed to every student, you should have an impressive web in the center of your circle. Take a moment to admire it and remind students that it took everyone’s effort to create this beautiful work of art. Learn more: Mrs. Fotini’s English Class 5. Windows If you’re looking for elementary icebreakers that allow students to share something from home, try this activity. Using masking tape, divide a bulletin board or empty wall in your classroom into “window panes,” one for each student in your class. Assign two students each day to bring in a small artifact that represents who they are. At morning meeting, ask each student to present what they brought. Later, label one of the panes for each student and mount their item in the middle. When everyone has had a turn, you’ll have a lovely display for your class, and your students will know each other a little better. 6. Labels Pass out a 2\" x 4\" mailing label to each student. Instruct them to fill in their label with the following: Center: name Top left corner: one word that describes their personality Top right corner: favorite subject in school Bottom left corner: a hobby Bottom right corner: favorite place Or tailor the topics to fit your particular set of students. Once everyone is finished with their label, set a timer for three minutes and have each student pair up with a classmate to talk about their labels. When the timer goes off, everyone switches partners, and the process repeats. Continue mingling until students have had a chance to get to know many of their classmates. 7. Inside, Outside Circle The best elementary icebreakers allow students to get to know everyone in the classroom. For this activity, divide your class in half and line them up in two circles, one inside (A) and one outside (B). Have students in each circle turn to face the classmate adjacent to them in the other circle. Choose a topic, such as “my favorite thing to do on weekends,” and have students in circle A talk and students in circle B listen. Then switch so that B talks and A listens. When everyone is done, have the students in the outside circle rotate one student to their left. Pick a new topic and give each student in each pair a chance to share. Repeat. Learn more: Eastern Washington University 8. Observation Pair students up and have them form two lines, partners facing each other. If your class has an odd number of students, you can play the game too. Give students 30 seconds to look each other over, paying close attention to all the details about their partner’s appearance. Ask students in one line to turn around and face the other direction. Students in the other line will now change one thing about their appearance. For example, one student might put their shoes on opposite feet, and another may remove a clip from their hair. When the students in the first line turn back around, they have to guess what their partner changed. Now switch and let the first line make the change and the second line guess the difference. If you have time, have students change partners and play again. 9. Colors To prepare for this activity, write the following information on a large piece of chart paper, then cover it until after the activity begins. Red—a favorite summer memory Green—your favorite thing about school Blue—a favorite sport, hobby, or activity Yellow—one of your favorite books Black—free choice (share anything) Now, put together a bucket of colored pipe cleaners with the same colors. To begin the activity, pass the bucket around and ask each student to take five pieces, each one a different color. Now, reveal the chart. Give each student a turn to introduce themselves and give one fact for each pipe cleaner. After everyone has had a chance, let the students twist their pipe cleaners together to make a bracelet, necklace, or headband. 10. Emojis Need elementary icebreakers you can use for online classes? Give students a list of topics and ask them to share information using only emojis in the text feature. See the example below. If you are teaching in person, have students answer on paper and design their own emojis. Family: ",

      "title": "One Piece Live-Action Series: Theme Song Reveled, Cast, and More",
      "text": "Eiichiro Oda’s cherished manga, One Piece, has revealed the lead single, “WEALTH FAME POWER,” written by the gifted songwriters, composers, and music producers Sonya Belousova and Giona Ostinelli, best known for their work on “The Witcher.” The stage is prepared for a thrilling musical trip with the availability of this musical masterwork on numerous digital platforms. The whole soundtrack for the series will also be released on August 31 in conjunction with the show’s official premiere on Netflix, which will be a nice extra for fans. One Piece Live-Action Series: Theme Song Reveled, Cast, and More Advertisements Sonya Belousova and Giona Ostinelli, the maestros behind “WEALTH FAME POWER,” shared their insights and inspirations for this phenomenal composition: “’Wealth Fame Power!’ – These were the legendary words of Gold Roger, the fearsome Pirate King, who possessed not only these riches but everything the world had to offer. His parting message ignited the flames of adventure in countless souls, propelling them onto the high seas in search of his hidden treasure. Interestingly, there are remarkable parallels between Gold Roger and the Straw Hat Pirates’ captain, Monkey D. Luffy. Their personalities and character traits are uncannily aligned, and so are their musical themes. Monkey D. Luffy’s theme serves as the cornerstone of our show, while Gold Roger’s theme is a mesmerizing reverse reflection. ‘Wealth Fame Power’ commences with the majestic notes of Roger’s theme – a powerful, driving, and dynamic composition, perfectly mirroring the character himself. This musical journey features the iconic ‘musical Jolly Roger,’ brought to life by the hurdy-gurdy. However, as the swords are drawn and the crowd rushes out in pursuit of ONE PIECE, we seamlessly transition to Luffy’s theme, the heart and soul of our series. Roger’s theme symbolizes descent, marking the culmination of his epic journey, while Luffy’s theme embodies ascent, symbolizing the commencement of his thrilling adventure towards claiming the title of the Pirate King.” Oda’s Vision and the Series’ Progress The visionary creator of One Piece, Eiichiro Oda, also assumes the role of executive producer for the live-action series. In May, he reassured fans that the series would only launch when he is completely satisfied with the production’s quality. Oda emphasized the harmonious collaboration of all parties involved, ensuring that every aspect aligns with his creative vision. Notably, the series has been adjusted to consist of eight episodes, a slight departure from the initial plan of ten episodes. A Stellar Cast Ready to Set Sail The live-action adaptation boasts a stellar ensemble cast, including: Iñaki Godoy as Monkey D. Luffy Mackenyu as Roronoa Zoro Emily Rudd as Nami Jacob Romero Gibson as Usopp Taz Skylar as Sanji Morgan Davies as Koby Ilia Isorelýs Paulino as Alvida Aidan Scott as Helmeppo McKinley Belcher III as Arlong Vincent Regan as Garp Peter Gadiot as Shanks Alexander Maniatis as Klahadore Steven Ward as Mihawk Craig Fairbrass as Chef Zeff Langley Kirkwood as Captain Morgan Celeste Loots as Kaya Chioma Umeala as Nojiko Colton Osorio as Young Monkey D. Luffy Moreover, fans of the original Japanese anime can rejoice, as the Japanese voice actors for Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji will reprise their roles in the Japanese dub. For Spanish-speaking viewers, Iñaki Godoy and Taz Skylar will lend their voices to Luffy and Sanji, respectively, in the Spanish dub. The Creative Forces Behind the Series The live-action adaptation of One Piece is brought to life by Tomorrow Studios, a partnership between producer Marty Adelstein, renowned for his work on “Prison Break” and “Teen Wolf,” and ITV Studios. The show’s script is crafted by Matt Owens, known for his contributions to “Luke Cage” and “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” Serving as executive producers are Steven Maeda and Becky Clements, ensuring that the series stays true to its roots while exploring new horizons. In a message relayed at Jump Festa in 2017, Marty Adelstein shared that the live-action Hollywood television series would kick off with the East Blue arc and expand from there. He expressed his commitment to creating a faithful adaptation of “One Piece” after engaging in discussions about the project with Eiichiro Oda himself. Advertisements The upcoming One Piece live-action series promises to be an epic journey, both musically and visually, as it brings the beloved world of pirates, treasures, and dreams to a whole new audience while paying homage to its loyal fanbase. Mark your calendars for August 31, when this extraordinary adventure sets sail on Netflix, promising to be a treasure trove of entertainment for fans old and new.

      "title": "Author Who Debunked RFK Jr. A Decade Ago Thinks His Candidacy Is ‘Pretty Depressing’",
      "text": "Two decades before he was a candidate for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was just starting to make a name for himself as an anti-vaccine activist. In 2005, he stormed onto the scene with “Deadly Immunity,” a 4,700-word piece co-published by Salon and Rolling Stone that, within days, had racked up numerous corrections. In the piece, through a mix of bad science, bad math and spliced-together quotes from a meeting of public health officials, Kennedy wrote a tantalizing ― but false ― story about the medical establishment allegedly seeking to cover up evidence that vaccines were harmful to children. After reviewing the evidence concerning thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative that was once used in childhood vaccines, “I became convinced that the link between thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood neurological disorders is real,” Kennedy wrote. In the years since, Kennedy has become one of the most influential anti-vaccine voices in the world, along with since-discredited physician and researcher Andrew Wakefield. (HuffPost helped in that effort, publishing blogs that denigrated vaccines from Kennedy and others on its unpaid contributor platform. Those posts, along with others spreading misinformation about vaccines, have since been removed from the site.) The “link” that Kennedy promoted in “Deadly Immunity” isn’t real. Studies have repeatedly found no connection between thimerosal and autism. Notably, aside from some flu vaccines, thimerosal hasn’t been used as an ingredient in childhood vaccines in the United States since 2001 ― and there’s been no correlating drop in autism diagnoses. Still, for years, Kennedy’s article remained available online to Salon and Rolling Stone readers. That changed in 2011, with the publication of “The Panic Virus,” in which journalist Seth Mnookin explored the falsehoods and misdirections that fueled the anti-vaccine movement. Mnookin’s book included an entire chapter on Kennedy. Rolling Stone removed Kennedy’s article. Salon published an interview with Mnookin, and wrote in a retraction notice that his book “further eroded any faith we had in the story’s value.” A few weeks ago, Joan Walsh, Salon’s former editor-in-chief, credited Mnookin again, writing in The Nation that his book “ultimately helped convince us to retract the piece entirely.” Kennedy hasn’t forgotten, either. In June, as part of a response to another critic of his claims, he told the editors of National Review that Mnookin’s book is “a lengthy recitation of Pharma/CDC patently erroneous talking points, devoid of serious scientific analysis,” and that it contains “an overheated and venomous pop-psychological screed against vaccine safety advocates.” Kennedy has ultimately maintained his stance against vaccines, describing criticisms as “censorship” and his opponents as “big shots” and “bullies” who “believe that they can get away with anything, including destroying the lives of our children.” After Kennedy was banned from Instagram in 2021 for sharing anti-vaccine misinformation, he wrote: “Facebook, the pharmaceutical industry and its captive regulators use the term ‘vaccine misinformation’ as a euphemism for any factual assertion that departs from official pronouncements about vaccine health and safety, whether true or not. This kind of censorship is counterproductive if our objective is a safe and effective vaccine supply.” (He’s since gotten his account back.) With relatively poor poll numbers, Kennedy is likely not a serious threat to Joe Biden’s renomination. But he’s also probably not quitting any time soon. And with conservative outlets like Fox News willing to give him tons of free media, Kennedy has a larger microphone than ever. These days, Mnookin is the director of the Graduate Program in Science Writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. With Kennedy using his presidential candidacy to reach new audiences, HuffPost spoke to Mnookin about how it feels to see Kennedy’s resurgence, how the political leanings of anti-vaccine activism have changed over the years, and why Mnookin doesn’t think there’s a responsible way to debate such activists. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. I wonder if you feel a sense of deja vu now that RFK Jr. is getting so much attention. How are you feeling these days about your book, and where it stands 12 years later? Yeah, I mean, it’s pretty depressing. What Joan [Walsh] described, accurately, back in 2011, was the fact that when you looked at the evidence, and when you looked at what RFK Jr. was claiming, it clearly didn’t add up. His original piece in Rolling Stone and Salon was almost a textbook example of how you can technically fact-check something and say, ‘Oh, yes, these words actually do exist in this transcript,’ but by taking words and moving quotes around and to make it seem like one sentence was said before another when it was not, by removing context, you take a nuanced, responsible conversation, and make it seem like this incredible conspiracy. It’s unfortunate it took six years to retract “Deadly Immunity,” but my feeling at the time was, ‘This is pretty definitive.’ But my feeling at the time was also ― within those two years [2010-2011], Andrew Wakefield, who had initially published a lot of the bogus claims about vaccines, his paper was retracted by The Lancet, and he lost his medical license in the U.K. My feeling at the time was, ‘All right, we can move past this.’ And I think we’ve seen both of those cases, that obviously isn’t true, that I was more optimistic than I should have been. So how do you understand Kennedy’s support these days compared to where he stood in 2005 or 2011? Some people say it’s just a matter of Republicans supporting a challenger to Joe Biden. Do you believe that? Is this maybe reflective of a surge in anti-vaccine beliefs? I guess I would say that it’s neither just a surge in anti-vaccine beliefs nor just Republicans propping up an opponent of Biden. On the Democratic side, there’s clearly an interest in someone besides Biden. How that will ultimately shake out in the election is hard to say. While RFK Jr. is appearing on a lot of conspiracy-minded, right-wing troll podcasts and websites, he clearly does have some appeal beyond just that group of the electorate. One of the things that I’ve frequently found confusing is that, if you look at the numbers nationally for vaccine uptake, they’re consistently high. The uptake rates for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine are well over 90%. The uptake for even the COVID vaccine is very high, and so what you see is a sort of disconnect. I wouldn’t attribute the interest in his campaign to just anti-vaccine sentiment, so much as I would attribute it to a general sense that, writ large, quote, ‘the fix is in’ ― that there’s some nefarious force that is controlling people’s lives. And he speaks to that conspiracy-minded belief. When you see the audience that someone like Joe Rogan has, when you see the appeal that Donald Trump has ― and the significant portions of the GOP electorate that continue to not only support him, but say that they believe that there was a massive conspiracy in the 2020 election ― there clearly is a deeper sentiment in the country, and in the world right now, that there are forces that we don’t understand that are controlling society. I think that’s one of the things that he taps into. My feeling about the vaccine controversies that started in the late ’90s surrounding thimerosal and the MMR vaccine was that there were a number of bad actors, but ultimately, that really it was the media that was responsible for that, because the media treated what was a settled scientific issue as if it was an ‘on the one hand, on the other hand’ debate, when it wasn’t. And I think that’s hugely irresponsible, and coverage like that now is one of the reasons why, at this point, Kennedy has some of the support that he has. My hope, and my suspicion, is that that support is pretty squishy ― that once people start looking into his views a little bit more, that will sort of crater. But that’s also dependent on coverage of him being more responsible than it has been in many cases so far. Describing his views as ‘controversial,’ I think, is dishonest. They’re not controversial. They’re false. He’s not spreading controversial views, he’s spreading lies. And so the framing matters enormously, and that’s something that I foresee being a huge, huge issue in the 2024 campaign. The media coverage makes up a large part of your book, and reading back, the examples of the type of coverage that Andrew Wakefield got were pretty egregious. HuffPost played a big role in what I would call very generous coverage of the anti-vaccine movement, and we’ve since removed a lot of those articles and replaced them with editors’ notes. I wonder, 12 years later, have journalists gotten better at not taking anti-vaccine activists at their word? What we saw in the decade after 2011 was much more responsible coverage, generally, of vaccines. I should emphasize, when I cite 2011, I’m not at all saying that that’s a demarcation line because of my book, by any stretch of the imagination. I’m saying that, in that two-year period, 2010-2011, Wakefield’s paper was retracted, RFK Jr.’s piece was retracted, Wakefield lost his medical license. There were these other events that happened. From that point on, when you saw coverage of childhood vaccines, the coverage was ― not all the time, but in general ― much more responsible. If there was going to be any discussion of these conspiracy claims about childhood vaccines being harmful, the framing was almost always that those were disproven, and that was the way that the article was presented. That changed a little bit with the COVID vaccine. Some of that was understandable, because you had a new vaccine on the market that had not gone through the types of testing that most vaccines have gone through, because of the direness of the situation. So it was understandable that some of that coverage was not as immediately accepting of the efficacy and safety of those vaccines. What we saw, then, start to creep into the coverage, and what I found so disturbing, was not the raising of legitimate questions, but really, the same type of BS, disproven, bogus studies or case series that you saw in the late ’90s and 2000s, trying to show that childhood vaccines weren’t safe. You saw some of those same types of really shoddy studies getting attention around the COVID vaccine. I think a more responsible way to cover that would have been to say, ’All of the research we had so far says that these vaccines that have been developed are safe. However, they have not been on the market for long, et cetera, et cetera.’ As opposed to saying, ‘Well, there’s this concern that’s being raised, and maybe that’s true.’ That’s the type of coverage that I always think is really wildly irresponsible. There was a campaign last month that Joe Rogan tried to put together, to pressure the vaccine scientist Peter Hotez to debate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Rogan’s show. Hotez declined. Is there a version of engaging with those arguments in a debate that can be productive? No, I don’t think so. It’s the same reason that I refused to debate Andrew Wakefield when my book came out, and the same reason I wouldn’t debate RFK Jr. When you’re dealing with someone who is completely divorced from facts, it’s impossible to win a debate. If you are committed to reality, and if you are committed to evidence, it’s impossible to win a debate with someone who isn’t. One of the reasons is because no matter how much evidence you come prepared with, if you’re debating someone who is willing to say anything and willing to make any claim, they can then just make up some new claim in the debate, and if you are responsible and only relying on evidence, you will have to say, ‘I don’t know, I don’t have the answer to that, that’s something that has just come up for the first time.’ And in a debate, what that sounds like is, ‘Aha, we got you. See, we knew that you couldn’t show that this was X, Y or Z.’ It becomes a game of whack-a-mole, and the reason that you can never win a game of whack-a-mole is, no matter how many moles you knock down, they keep popping up. Another reason is because I think it’s important for people who do depend on evidence, and on data, to hold the people that they come in contact with to that same standard. So if Peter Hotez said, ‘Yes, I’m going to debate RFK Jr.,’ then essentially it’s saying, ‘Here are two people on two different sides of this issue, and we’re going to listen to both of their views.’ When the reality is, one of those is a respected scientist with decades and decades of experience, and the other is a wing nut who has been pulling claims out of his ass for decades, and whenever he’s shown to be wrong, just moves on to the next crazy claim. You mentioned that the uptake of most pediatric vaccines is at or near 90%, and you’ve said before that most parents would be surprised at how infrequently parents decline recommended vaccines. Has the media over-inflated the level of popularity that the so-called anti-vaccine movement has? You raise a really excellent point, which is that the tenor of the coverage of the anti-vaccine movement gives the impression that it’s a huge portion of the population. I think a lot of people would feel more comfortable with their decisions around vaccines if they learned the reality of the situation, which is that is not true. Even the uptake for the first dose of the COVID vaccine was over 80%, and that was for a new vaccine where there was a ton of politicization of it, and a lot of people on the GOP side saying that it was a mistake to get it. The degree of anti-vaccine sentiment is exaggerated by the coverage of the anti-vaccine movement, and it’s a problem in the media more broadly. When you wrote your book, you wrote about progressive enclaves like Brooklyn and Marin County, California. It seems like the Trump years and COVID-19 have scrambled the partisan balance of folks who might pass on vaccines, either pediatric or COVID-19. Have you found that to be the case? And if so, where do you think Kennedy fits in this new landscape? When I wrote in my book that there were these enclaves of seemingly liberal-minded parents where vaccine uptake was lower than it was in the country as a whole, I didn’t mean to imply that that also was not true in some areas that were more conservative. One thing that is interesting about the anti-vaccine movement ― and was more true then, I think, than it is now ― is that you found anti-vaccine pockets on both the right and the left, which was somewhat uncommon in terms of hot-button political issues. I think what we’ve seen over the last three or four years with COVID is that there is more appetite for anti-vaccine rhetoric on the right than there is on the left. If you look at vaccine uptake rates around the country, that seems to bear out: Democrat-voting states have, for instance, significantly higher COVID vaccine uptake rates than Republican-voting states. That said, I’m not sure that it has scrambled what we were seeing a decade ago as much as it has expanded the numbers of people willing to identify as being skeptical of vaccines, and expanded it more in one direction than the other. If I picture Kennedy’s supporters, it’s kind of a conglomeration of the pre-COVID anti-vaccine movement, and the post-COVID, expanded anti-vaccine movement. That is, people from liberal areas ― he’s swum in those same circles for a long time ― as well as, maybe, Trump supporters who want to see someone like Kennedy elevated politically. Do you think he is the anti-vaccine candidate across the political spectrum? Because it seems from the outside that that’s who he’s aiming for. Trump, obviously, has the support of a fair number of people who are anti-vaccine. But I think one mistake that we make as political observers is assuming that voting is a rational act, as opposed to an emotional act. And so I think whatever percentage of people end up voting for RFK Jr., there will probably be a significant portion of them that do not identify as anti-vaccine, but for some reason for another, feel like they like him, or feel like they don’t like Biden, or feel like Biden is too old, or have fond memories of the Kennedy dynasty, or something else that doesn’t have to do with vaccines. I think we’re seeing a lot of that, a lot of sort of vague, ‘Well, I don’t know if I want Biden. Plus, oh yeah, Kennedys.’ All of that thrown in together with some fervent anti-vaccine stuff as well. Ultimately, the number of people who vote for him will be much smaller, but it will not be just anti-vaccine people. You saw that with [former U.S. Rep.] Dennis Kucinich, who’s now helping Kennedy in his campaign. Kucinich, when he ran, had some pretty out-there opinions. I don’t think that the percentage of people who voted for him all shared those opinions, so much as some people just felt like it was time for someone to get in and change the system. They needed new voices. They need someone willing to speak truth to power. So I think when you see fringe candidates, it’s a mistake to interpret their support as support for all of those views. Kennedy has rejected the label ‘anti-vaccine,’ even though, as NBC’s Brandy Zadrozny pointed out, he’s on record telling people that when he goes on hikes and he sees somebody with a newborn baby, he says, ‘Better not get them vaccinated.’ Why do you think it is important to him that he not be stuck with this ‘anti-vaxxer’ label? That same sort of rhetorical sleight of hand is what anti-vaccine activists have been doing literally for as long as there have been anti-vaccine activists. They insist that they’re just in favor of ‘safe’ vaccines, or ‘safer’ vaccines, or they’re in favor of different types of testing. His whole point is that he’s not dogmatic about this, he’s just following the research, and viewing someone as pro- or anti-anything is essentially saying that you’re dogmatic. So I think that’s why it’s important to him. Also, as evidenced by the over 90% of parents who vaccinate their kids, most of the country is in favor of vaccines and do not want to get vaccine-preventable illnesses. In some ways, that denial serves as cover, both for him and for his potential voters. But it’s completely ridiculous and false. He clearly is anti-vaccine. He’s shown [that] with literally everything he’s ever said about vaccines since that Rolling Stone-Salon story came out, and with his absolute steadfast refusal to ever accept evidence that contradicts what he feels like is true. That’s sort of the definition of someone being dogmatic. Earlier this month, Kennedy claimed during a press event that there’s an argument that COVID-19 “is ethnically targeted,” that it “attacks certain races disproportionally,” that it’s “targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people,” and that Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people are “most immune” to the virus. (In a tweet after the New York Post published a recording of his remarks, Kennedy denied suggesting “that the COVID-19 virus was targeted to spare Jews.”) What did you make of that? I had a couple reactions to that. One was, [the idea that] ‘they’re designed to target certain people’ is right in line with this notion of there being some big, bad, evil force that is trying to control the population. Why he felt compelled to then make that extra racist, by saying that it was not targeting Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, is beyond me. I have no idea what his possible motivations for that could have been, apart from maybe thinking that there’s some upside to appealing to antisemites and people who have anti-Asian sentiment. I found that to be incredibly bizarre, and again, I think it shows that if you put a microphone in front of him, he will say anything, just spout all sorts of incredibly dangerous nonsense. During a period where hate crimes are on the rise, for any political figure to stand up and essentially borrow antisemitic and anti-Asian tropes is just so insanely irresponsible. And it speaks to someone who is both not a serious person, but is also completely willing to burn things down around him for who knows what reason. Rebecca Traister, in her story in New York magazine, did a good job of getting to some of this. She wrote that he “either has no idea what kind of fire he’s playing with, or does and is therefore an arsonist.” I think that’s spot on. Either he’s irresponsible because he doesn’t realize that making statements that can be perceived as antisemitic and anti-Asian is not only irresponsible but potentially dangerous ― or he does know what he’s doing, and is trying to light a fire. What has changed over the years that Kennedy, who was maybe at one point more of a fringe figure, is now polling pretty substantially, if not enough to be a real threat? I definitely do not think he has changed. Really the only thing that has changed is that he announced that he’s running for president, and I think what we’re seeing is that the American media has still not figured out how to responsibly cover someone with really dangerous views. We saw this, obviously, in 2016, with Trump. Right before RFK Jr. announced that he was running for president, he was still pretty widely considered to be an incredibly fringe character with completely debunked ideas, and if he’d had a press conference announcing ‘I’ve decided X about vaccines,’ he would have gotten very little coverage. What he perceived, correctly, is that all he has to do is announce that he’s running for president, and then those same views that would not have gotten any attention previously are all of a sudden getting major coverage. That’s the big thing that has changed. What I mean when I say ‘I don’t think the American media has learned how to deal with this,’ is there’s a pretty well-established body of research showing that all you need to do is say something for a certain percentage of people to come away thinking that it’s true. It becomes a real problem when you have fringe characters who then figure out that, ‘Oh, I can get attention for these views just by announcing that I’m going to throw my hat into the political ring.’ It’s a dangerous combination. What should our readers keep in mind as they read that coverage of him, wherever it may be coming from? Do you have any advice on how to absorb media coverage of a candidacy like his, without getting sucked into the narratives he’s trying to push out there? I think there has been some responsible coverage of him. Rebecca Traister’s piece. Jake Tapper, I thought, wrote a very good piece on CNN because RFK Jr. was really almost hilariously misrepresenting an interaction that he’d had with Jake a while back. I guess this is more what I think media outlets should do. It’s tough, because when you’re asking that question, what I’m thinking is, ‘If you’re already listening to Joe Rogan’s podcast, what would I recommend that you do?’ I guess my recommendation would be, ‘Don’t listen to Joe Rogan’s podcast and expect responsible coverage of political or medical issues.’ But that’s not going to fly, obviously, for his fans. So I think being a proactive consumer of news is an important step. Instead of just taking whatever comes across your feed, if you’re curious about someone like RFK Jr., find news outlets that you respect and trust and look up what their coverage of him is. I think, not just around this issue but in general, being proactive news consumers, as opposed to passive news consumers, is a really important step. We have seen, in American public life, how difficult it is to keep a conspiracy hidden, right? The tobacco companies were not able to do it. The Catholic Church was not able to do it. The FBI was not able to do it when they were spying on American citizens. And those were all groups that are much more closed than the massive conspiracy that would need to be taking place for one hundredth of what someone like RFK Jr. claims to be true. You would need to have a conspiracy between world governments, between multiple different pharmaceutical companies, between public health officials at multiple different agencies. It would be the type of vast conspiracy that the world has never seen. To imagine both that that is what’s happening, and also that somehow it has been kept secret all of this time, is kind of the definition of insanity.",

      "title": "Irish street artist Maser: ‘All I look for is openness’",
      "text": "Modern Irish graffiti then, the kind bold in messaging, and all-too-often painted over by State-funded organisations, proves bold in its contemporary politics, all the while providing free-to-visit art in a city chastised for underfunding creatives. While connotations of street art can be fraught, few burst through the noise to cement themselves, and their art, as important cultural icons. One of these centric spirits is Maser (real name Al Hester), a contemporary visual artist whose work is astonishingly prolific, blanketing the city with spray-painted stencils and deep socialist messaging. It dares to ask us all the same question: Are you alive? Creating since 1995, Maser’s work has inspired a dedicated following around the world, despite his home city’s long-standing war against street art by way of gentrification. His most famous pieces make use of bold, primary colours in contrasting stencilled lines, some committed to words (The City is my Garden, U Are Alive*, Maser Loves You), some not. It commits to a free-for-all transformation, bringing art to the artless and hard-discussed topics like religion and immigration to the fore. Because of this, his work is digestible, ambitious, and new. But what makes his work so absorbing is Maser’s playful use of juxtaposition. “If you’re gonna do a piece on the street somewhere, you want it to be seen and loud. So you introduce colours that you know will do that,” he says from a seat in his Dublin 2 studio. “I’ll always start with something warm and then introduce colder shades to sort of balance hot and cold and loosen things up a bit. I like the idea of people seeing my movement within it; seeing my hand mark there and choices there. It kind of brings it home a bit.” The morning we meet in Atelier Now, his Charlemont Street studio, Maser’s current and past work shows traces of the masters some might deem are before his time; Twombly’s sensitivity, Koons’ boldness, Warhol’s anarchy. What’s obvious, though, is that Maser’s sprayed lines, buckling contrasts and eloquent splatters, are all his. “Sorry about this,” he smiles. “It’s a bit of a kip at the moment.” Water shuffles loudly through pipes as we speak and Hester laughs. Up to 20 unfinished works are mounted behind him — in a way that makes them appear as if they’re floating — on bright, white walls. “I’m impatient so always have to be working on a few things at once,” he says. “Otherwise I’d just be waiting for paint to dry the whole time. It works out because they kind of end up inspiring and influencing each other.” He reveals his favourite piece of work when pressed. “The Repeal piece was great when it was there,” he smiles, alluding to the compromisation of the political art piece by Dublin City Council who informed the Project Arts Centre (whose wall bore the piece) that it was in violation of planning rules. “It’s funny, I was adamant at the time that it was not my piece, per se. That I was never going to be taking ownership of it — it belonged to others. “But in hindsight, I look back on it, and it was pretty incredible. I don’t think it was an incredible piece of work or anything like that, it just sort of gave something that everyone could sort of communicate with.” He pauses, asking me to look behind me at a large-scale photograph. “I also can’t answer that question without mentioning the Ballymun Flats piece.” (In 2009, prior to its demolition, Maser worked with Damien Dempsey to paint a string of Dempsey’s lyrics ‘Concrete Jungle Mother Farewell to your Stairwell Forever’, on a nine-storey block in Ballymun.) “That got me to take a moment, sit back and say to myself, ‘Fuck, that’s pretty wild’. I was really proud of that.” While some may still need convincing, street art is slowly but surely no longer representing the offence it once did. Many rejoice in public art, cementing its rightful place as part of a hometown’s romantic, rough-and-tumble past, preserved in museums and coffee table books. There was once a time when that might be laughable, but with initiatives like Colourama at Kildare Village, you’re as likely to see graffiti on streets of plush, luxury boutiques as hanging on the walls of the people who shop there. For Maser, this evocatively breaks down barriers further. “It’s another avenue, another stream for artists to make a living,” he says. “As long as that aligns with your intentions, absolutely it’s a good thing. Commercial gigs are what gave me the ability to do art as a full-time job.” Colourama is Kildare Village’s new street festival celebrating art, music, wellness, and fashion throughout the summer with a glut of the country’s most prominent artists, musicians, and wellness experts. Maser has contributed a mural. “They got onto me and said they love what I’m doing — providing a space for artists to create — and they wanted to do something similar. And that’s exactly what they’re doing. And so they got me to come out and do a mural to kind of be a part of the lead of Colourama alongside two other artists.” The initiative forms part of a commitment that Kildare Village has to showcasing the creative talent across our island, says Kildare Village Business Director Victor Biffi Rosano. “We are immensely proud to work with and showcase the best in Irish talent across art, music, wellness and of course fashion in the Colourama festival, including Irish artists Maser and James Kirwan and Irish musicians Aimee Fitzpatrick, Tolü Makay, and Kildare native Ryan Mack. \"These collaborations give our guests the opportunity to experience the best of Irish creativity in many forms across the Village. \"We are delighted to continue to provide a platform for Irish talent and to deliver these exciting experiences to our guests.” “It’s been pretty fun, and much more glamorous than anywhere else I’ve painted,” Maser laughs. “I’m kind of used to car parks and the backs of pubs.” Like it or not, Maser, now 42 and a father of one-and-a-half-year-old Alfie (“what I’ve learned from parenthood is that I can function on about three hours’ sleep”), is arguably among the most important Irish artists of his generation. You might fondly wish, as I’m sure some do, for a champion whose art is hung in expensive, deep-set frames, only to be hung in galleries and restaurant bathrooms. But Maser’s choices, startling in their simplicity and rich in their morality, are the reasons behind his success; his stencilled repetition of colour and font choosing to crack open a soul instead of hiding within it. If you are put off by the supposed harshness of public art, it means you might not be ready to confess to the questions he asks. But once you stop resisting Maser’s mien, his work feels authentic, bracing and even, on occasion, calming. “All I’m ever looking for with my work is openness,” he says. “Don’t look too deep. I’m just going to put this here and you can respond to it in whatever way you want. Even when I do shows and talk about work, I try not to hammer down too fine of a point. People can project what they want. “I’m just happy they have a space where they can do that. And if in that process, people get a bit of joy and happiness, that’s enough for me.” To make the world appear uniformly colourful requires rare discipline — the kind Maser makes feel nonchalant. His work, previously primarily in cities, will shine in Kildare, the Village creating a blank canvas for minds like his to guide. For Irish people, Maser and his counterparts made beautiful, powerful street art and topography new; merging the anonymous aggression of graffiti with the stateliness of formal abstract painting. It’s something for which he counts himself entirely lucky. “I’ve gotten used to the idea of my art being quite transient, due to being knocked down or painted over or whatever. “But I’ve realised that it kind of adds to the beauty of it all. Like I’ve done huge works over the world in Vegas and Sydney and stuff, but as I’ve gotten older, I realise how lucky I am to be creating here in Ireland, and in a place where I’m genuinely happy. It’s really loosened up my work, and kind of eliminated that fear of judgement.” He pauses, before saying finally: “It’s my meditation as well as my work, and getting to do it in the place I am now is a joy. “Even if people still go to my Instagram to comment, ‘That’s bollocks’, every once in a while.” From immersive experiences to vibrant murals and installations, this summer sees Kildare Village take on the role of canvas for some of Ireland’s leading and emerging talent. Contemporary Irish artists James Kirwin and Shane O’Malley have also been commissioned alongside Maser to bring their signature colourful style to Colourama. London-based DJ and broadcaster Tara Kumar will bring festival beats to those keen to groove, with Wild Youth just one of the music acts performing as part of the line-up.",

      "title": "‘One Piece’ Dub Cast Tease Episode 1000 &amp; Gear 5 Luffy - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "The One Piece anime has been around since 1999, and after reaching its 1000th episode, the long-running series has never been better. After almost 25 years, the original manga is reaching its final stretch, which in turn, has the anime nearing the same conclusion. As such, several moments are being celebrated alongside its 1000-episode milestone, like its upcoming live-action series on Netflix and Luffy’s new internet-breaking Gear 5 transformation. Now, after several licensing issues causing the dub to falter in its pace, is only a little over a year behind the initial airing of Episode 1000 in Japan. To celebrate the achievement, voice actors Colleen Clinkenbeard (the English voice of Luffy), Luci Christian (the English voice of Nami), Sonny Strait (the English voice of Usopp), and Eric Vale (the English voice of Sanji) spoke with TV Insider about its new production pace, what Episode 1000 means to them, and the dub’s upcoming Gear 5 moment. What’s the experience of blitzing through the dub so fast? Eric Vale (Sanji): Like blitzing through something! During a pandemic, no less. Sonny Strait (Usopp): We’re making the Halls company richer by buying all their cough drops. Colleen Clinkenbeard (Luffy): I feel like during the pandemic, it felt like we were ramping up production on One Piece, and it was an odd time to be ramping up because we were all doing this so separately. We were at home. I was recording without a director or an engineer for a while there. It was very isolating at a time when it was also so exciting. So that was super odd, but it also meant that when we came back together, and we were finally recording in booth, and we had these directors who were so excited about the show, it was like a match catching fire, like, “Oh, my gosh! We’re back!” And we were so stoked to be with people, talking about the show altogether and talking about it with fans when we’re having the same experience they’re having, and I think that it has only increased since then in terms of hype and how into it we all are. We all go to cons together, and the chances that we get to talk about it together. It’s kind of gone from, “Oh, I love this show, I wish more people were watching it,” to now, It’s like everybody’s watching it! Strait: It was very surreal recording at home alone. And then, all of a sudden, we’re going to conventions together, and remember the first one we went to with several of us on stage, and I was trying to keep it together because I felt like crying the whole time. Because I was like, “are you people real? [Laughs] Luci Christian (Nami): I remember that, Sonny! We were talking, going, “Are you guys having as much fun as I am in Wholecake Island?” and we’re all like, “Yes, it’s so much fun!” And Anthony, who is our director, was like, “It’s so much fun, and it’s just a blast.” And then suddenly, everybody else is just talking about One Piece. And after working on it. We did the math; it’s been 16 years. What an amazing feeling to [all be] in the same room. Are SimulDubs on the way? Clinkenbeard: We have no way of knowing! And I try never to hope for that. This is a big production. This is a lot of cogs in a machine, and getting them to all spin that quickly? Who knows, but I’m trying not to lean on it. The fact that we are this close is fantastic. Christian: It’s amazing, […] for years, right, you look at your One Piece scripts, and it’s, you know, how many Fishmen, how many villagers, how many Marines, ust all kinds of people, insularly characters in this cast, in this universe, that has to be sort of wrangled and put in, aside from the Straw Hats and the villains du jour. It’s a lot. Strait: I’ve directed a few episodes, but I don’t do it anymore. That’s how hard it is. [Laugh] What are your favorite scenes of the Wano arc thus far that you’ve worked on? Clinkenbeard: I read Red Roc. Red Roc was like that moment. There was a lot of emotion. I was taking pictures of the screen for myself for later, and that’s the one that I want to talk about with people when it comes out. I’m so… I love it. Strait: The 1,000th episode when he (Usopp) gets to do something special on that, but I won’t say what it is. But I love the moments with Luci and also with Brina [Palencia]. Oh my god. We had so many fun scenes together. Clinkenbeard: I’m jealous you all have these scenes together. Christian: We’re all fighting Ulti forever, who is such a formidable foe! I mean, everything hangs in the balance. I’ve said it before, what I love about Wano, is the stakes are very high. These are not small battles. I mean, they’re rarely small battles. But it’s just like, “oh my gosh, are they about to get their butts kicked?” Because it looked like it. Colleen, your performance in the Sanji vs. Luffy moment was immaculate. What emotions were you trying to convey in that moment, delivering those lines? Clinkenbeard: Part of me is trying to convey how much this does not hurt! Christian: Real talk! Clinkenbeard: It’s just sustained screaming in that moment. And by that moment, I mean those moments. So that was probably the most vocally stressful thing that I’ve done in the entire series was yelling at Sanji in that carriage because it’s just right at the same level constantly. And that is as loud as I can scream, and lots of words at the same time. So it’s not just like a growl or “ahh” because then you can let it all out. It’s just the same talking. So that was very vocally stressful, but also, you have to fight through that because you want the emotion of the moment to carry. And that dense of Luffy giving absolutely anything for his friend. Like that is his number one priority, and that is him living in the moment completely. I don’t care what happens next. I don’t care what you did in your past, I don’t care; your past does not matter, I need you to realize that. What matters is what you do now. And that’s all Luffy is about all the time. What does One Piece Episode 1000 mean to you? Strait: I had a little bit of a different take on it. Because I was in an event when they were showing it in front of a crowd of fans, and I was just trying to keep it together because they were just cheering, and then the emotional roller coaster I was feeling just sitting next to hundreds of people watching it. And they were just reacting so positively. It really, it was very special. Clinkenbeard: [It’s such a] special milestone to get to when coming from a group of people who didn’t know if we’d ever be able to finish this. There were times when we wondered, you know if we were going to be continuing and to get here, and not only get here but get here with so much vocal support is emotional. In a way, like, I’m not a super emotional person… Strait & Christian: She’s not. Clinkenbeard: [Laughs] So that’s a big deal like to be dragged into this to the point where I’m like, “I am in it.” And that episode itself felt very self-aware. It felt like it knew this is a milestone for everybody. We’re all here together. This is for the fans; this is for the crew. For the people in Japan. This is for the people worldwide and all the voice actors everywhere, where you remember what your character came from and where you are now. And it was just a series of, like, “Remember this? Remember this? Remember this? And here we are.” And I love that self-aware nature of a celebration of Episode 1000. Christian: I mean, from the get-go, like with bringing back “We Are!” and beginning with that, with some new images of everybody who’s joined us along the way, like starting there. You know, I thought [was a] really, really great to set the tone. Vale: What has anybody done 1000 times? Really? You sleep, right? Other basic life functions, but to do anything 1000 times is unbelievable. And daunting. It’s like climbing a mountain you don’t realize you’re at the top of the mountain until you look back. You’re like, “Oh, so we did that? Okay, great.” Strait: Yeah, that’s exactly what it was like [with] 1000 episodes, looking back at the mountain we just climbed. Clinkenbeard: And now we get to ski down. Here’s a fun one. Any advice for your Netflix counterparts when it comes to portraying the characters that you guys voice? Colleen: I do, but we can’t because it’s part of the SAG strike. So… That’s right! Well, how do you feel about this? Where’s your stance? Where do voice actors fall into all of this? Clinkenbeard: I’ll speak for myself. I love actors Christian: Love actors. Clinkenbeard: [I] love writers. I love the fact that we get to do this for a living, and I want everybody who does it for a living to be able to make a living. And so I wish, I wish everybody the best. I live in a right-to-work state, and I am non-union. But that doesn’t mean I don’t understand what it is. And so I wish everybody the best. I want the good outcome. Bring us the good outcome. Have you been preparing your voice (and laugh) for Luffy’s Gear 5 delivery? What’s the process? Clinkenbeard: Definitely gearing up in terms of hype I know pretty much everything that’s gonna happen. But I’m refraining from watching it just yet. Because I want to watch it with my directors right before we record it, I think we’re all going to be in the room together. That was the decision, is not one director should get that moment. So it’s going to be the two directors of the show at the moment. We’re gonna watch it all together so that I can hear their feedback. We’re going to discuss what all we’ve read about what the voice actress was told about her performance. I’m just doing as much research as I can to prep for it. And I’m letting myself be nervous right now. Because in the moment, I can’t be nervous, because that would read, you would hear it. And he’s supposed to be absolutely carefree. So my goal is to let that just be as fun and frenetic and lively and carefree, and he’s supposed to be having the time of his life. I want that to read. So that’s my goal is to just enjoy the heck out of it. But for the moment, I’m stressing! Strait: [I’m] looking forward to that moment more than anything in the show. And I just watched the Japanese version today. And I was like, “Oh, I can’t wait to see Colleen do this.” This is going to be so much fun for you, Colleen. It’s amazing. Luci: Same! Christian: I’ve always wanted to play a Bugs Bunny-type character… Strait: It’s Bugs Bunny on overdrive. Clinkenbeard: I can’t wait! How’s it been watching One Piece with your kid? Where are you two in the show currently? Clinkenbeard: We’ve (the cast) seen the series as we’ve been doing it. But it’s been in kind of a disjointed way. And I had never just started at episode 1 and let it play. And so this is my first time through with that feeling of being an audience member rather than being from the production side. And watching it with my son was the best decision I could have made. Because he is so in. I mean, guys, he is in! [Laughs] Luffy is definitely his favorite character. With a side of Zoro, sorry [Eric Vale]. But he gets so fascinated by these specific things that I, as an audience member, am interested in other things. And so watching it from both perspectives at the same time is a huge kick. I’m so into it, and I like different characters than I did the first time through. And I’m so far removed from it that like I’m not mad at Eneru in the way that I was. I was so mad at Michael Tatum when we first did Skypeia because I fight him for episode after episode after episode of me climbing that stupid vine. And this time through, I am a passenger. I’m an audience member, and I get to just be like, “Oh, his voice is so good.” And Rhoades loves Eneru. It’s just it is a great bonding thing, and I cannot, I cannot recommend enough watching it with people, whether that’s your friends or your family, your kids. Try to see if your mom will watch it with you. It is such a great bonding thing. And that’s how I’m going to take it all the way through, and I don’t even want to watch the current episodes because I want to watch them when we get there. Christian: Awww. Clinkenbeard: Oh, but I still will. Christian: One of the things I have gotten watching it through with my kids is the exceptional cast outside of the Straw Hats. There are so many fun, great voices in the show. I mean, I think we’re on episode 72. We are still early days, but I will go to the mat for Buggy the Pirate. I mean, talk about a dude who is so awesome, and he definitely like fails up in regards to being a villain. But he’s just wonderful, and Mike McFarland gives him such a delightful presence he’s so great. Any other favorite characters outside the Straw Hats? Clinkenbeard: I love Mr. 2; Mr. 2 is so good. Christian: Carrot! Clinkenbeard: Foxy. Strait: Love Foxy.",

      "title": "43 Awesome Team-Building Games And Activities For Kids - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "Looking for great ways to help students learn to work together, listen carefully, communicate clearly, and think creatively? Try some of these awesome team-building activities for kids. They’re a super way to give your students the chance to get to know one another, build trust as a community, and, best of all, have fun! 1. Seeing Spots For this activity, you’ll place a colored sticker dot (blue, red, green, or yellow) on each student’s forehead without them knowing what color it is. When the game begins, each “team” of students (with the same color) must find each other—without speaking. This is a wonderful team-building activity because it encourages non-verbal communication and cooperation. 2. Elbow Pass Looking for team-building activities for kindergarten kids? This silly activity helps them make new friends and learn to work together. Not only do they get to work on hand-eye coordination, they are looking each other in the eye and having a laugh together. 3. Common Thread Divide students into groups of four and have them sit together in these small groups. Give each group five minutes to chat among themselves and find something they all have in common. It could be that they all play soccer, or pizza is their favorite dinner, or they each have a kitten. Whatever the common thread, the conversation will help them get to know one another better. Check in with the groups after five minutes to see if they need more time. After each group has come up with their common element, have them work together to create a flag that represents it. 4. Fingertip Hula-Hoop There are quite a few team-building activities for kids that use Hula-Hoops. In this game, your students stand in a circle and raise their arms with only their index fingers extended. Place a Hula-Hoop so that it rests on the tips of the children’s fingers. Tell the students they must maintain a fingertip on the Hula-Hoop at all times, but they are not allowed to hook their finger around it or otherwise hold the hoop; the hoop must simply rest on the tips of their fingers. The challenge is for the children to lower the hoop to the ground without dropping it. To make this more challenging, you can place communication constraints on the children—no talking or limited talking, for example. Watch the video for a demonstration. 5. Four-Way Tug-of-War This classic outdoor activity is double the fun of the traditional tug-of-war. Tie two long jump ropes together at their center points, creating an X shape. Tie a bandanna around the center point. Next, use cones to form a circle that fits around the X. Form four equal teams, and have each team stand at one of the four ends of the ropes. At your signal, each team begins pulling. The objective is to be the first team to pull the others in their direction far enough for the bandanna to cross to the outside of the circle of cones. Students who feel nervous about participating can serve as referees who make sure everyone is safe. 6. Hot Seat This fun game is a lot like the game show Password. Split your class into two teams and have them sit together in teams facing the whiteboard or chalkboard. Then take an empty chair—one for each team—and put it at the front of the class, facing the team members. These chairs are the “hot seats.” Choose one representative from each team to come up and sit in the “hot seat,” facing their teammates with their back to the board. Flash images one at a time on the screen behind the people in the hot seat. Taking turns, each team will offer one clue to their representative. If they guess the image correctly, their team gets one point. If not, it’s the other team’s turn to help their representative. Continue until one of the representatives gets the image correct. Then switch out students in the hot seat and continue. 7. Classification For this activity, prepare a tray with 20 unrelated items—for instance, a spool of thread, an eraser, a juice box, etc. Alternatively, create a document with 20 images of items to put up on the screen. Divide your class into even groups. Set a timer and have each group divide the 20 items into four categories that make sense to them. For example, they may put an earring, a glove, a headset, a sock, and a smile into the category “things you wear.” Have groups work quietly so that their ideas are kept secret. When each group is finished, give each one time to present their categories and their rationale behind each category. 8. Yes, No, Stand Up The version of the game above is designed specifically to help English-language learners, but it can also be used as a good “get to know you” game for younger kids. Prepare a list of yes or no questions to ask your students. For example, do you like chocolate? Is your favorite color blue? If their answer is yes, the student stands up. If their answer is no, they sit down. Pause between questions to give students time to look around and find students they have answers in common with. 9. Balloon Battle This fun game teams students up as they try to bat a balloon over each other’s goal line. Divide students into two teams. Each team will have five players on the field at one time. Periodically blow a whistle to have students substitute in so that everyone gets a chance to play. The first team to score 10 points wins. For more fun balloon games check out Happy Mom Hacks. 10. Move On, Look Back This hopping game will crack your students up. Start with students in a circle with their hands on the shoulders of the person in front of them. When you say “Move on,” students will take one hop forward together. When you say “Look back,” students will take one hop backward together. And when you say “Forever alone” (or any other phrase you’d like, such as “180” or “Turn around”), students will turn 180 degrees and place their hands on the shoulder of the person who was behind them. 11. Birthday Line-Up Did you know there are team-building activities for kids that can help teach students how to line up? It may take 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the age of your students, so plan accordingly. The objective is to have students line up in order of their birthdays—January 1 through December 31. To do this, they will need to know the order in which the months fall as well as their own birthday. They will also need to talk with one another in order to figure out who goes in front of whom. To make it super challenging, tell them they must do it without speaking at all, only using hand signals. Other ways to line up include by height, alphabetically, or by foot size. 12. The Perfect Square This activity requires strong verbal communication and cooperation. All you need is a long rope with the ends tied together and something to serve as blindfolds for students, such as bandannas or fabric strips. Have students stand in a circle holding the rope in front of them. Signal them to put their blindfolds on and set the rope on the ground in front of them. Ask students to turn and walk a short distance away from the circle. Assign a partner to any students who may need help. Finally, have everyone come back to the rope and try to form a perfect square with their blindfolds on. Set a time limit to make it more challenging. 13. Rock, Paper, Scissors Tag If you have a large space for kids to do team-building activities, try this one. Divide students into two teams. Before you begin, stake out the boundaries and position a home base at either end for each team. For each round, each team must confer and decide whether they will be rock, paper, or scissors. Have the two teams line up facing each other, and on your signal, have all players flash Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot! The kids on the losing team must run back to their base before they are tagged by one of the kids on the winning team. 14. Flip-the-Tarp Challenge Looking for creative-thinking team-building games and activities for kids? Divide students into two teams. One team will do the challenge first while the other team watches, then they will switch places. Have all members of the team stand on a flat bedsheet, tarp, or blanket (kids should fill up all but about a quarter of the space). Challenge the team to flip over the sheet/tarp so that they are standing on the other side of the sheet/tarp without stepping off or touching the ground. 15. “Get To Know You” Balloons Give each student an empty balloon and a slip of paper. Ask them to write a get-to-know-you question on their paper, such as How many brothers and sisters do you have? Do you have any pets? What’s one fun thing you did this summer? Next, have them put their question inside the balloon, blow it up, and tie the end. When everyone is ready, have them gather on the rug and, on your signal, toss their balloon up in the air. Give them a couple of minutes to bat the balloons around, then call stop. Have each student grab one balloon and come sit in a circle. Go around the circle and, one at a time, have students pop their balloon, read the question inside, and answer the question. This is one of those team-building activities for kids that they will always remember. And to help your students remember each others’ names, try these 30 Fun Name Games To Try With Your New Class. 16. Hot and Cold Form groups of three to five students. One person from each group (the finder) steps out of the classroom. The rest of the group picks an object (for instance, the pencil sharpener) in the classroom for the finder to find. When the finder comes back in, they begin walking around the classroom in search of the object. The others guide the finder by saying “hot” or “cold” to lead them in the right direction. If the finder is far away from the object, the group will say “cold.” When the finder gets close, the group will say “hot” until the finder picks the correct object. Variation: Instead of saying “hot” and “cold,” have students applaud softly for cold and applaud vigorously for hot. 17. Marshmallow-and-Toothpick Challenge Divide students into groups of equal numbers. Pass out an equal number of marshmallows and wooden toothpicks to each group. Challenge the groups to create the tallest, largest, or most creative structure in a set amount of time, each member taking turns doing the actual building. Afterward, have each group describe what they made. 18. Art Reproduction Puzzle Divide students into groups of six or eight (or larger if you want to make the task more difficult). Provide each team with an image and blank pieces of white card stock, one per team member. First, each team must cut up the image into the same number of pieces as there are group members. Then, each player will take one of the pieces of the image and reproduce it onto their blank piece of card stock with pencils, colored pencils, or markers. (If the team cuts the image into irregularly shaped pieces, each team member must then cut their blank paper into the same shape.) When every team has created the pieces of their puzzle, they will switch pieces with another team. The team will work together to solve the puzzle. 19. Hula-Hoop Pass This activity helps kids work on listening, coordinating, and strategizing skills. It works best with smaller students. Have your students stand in a big circle. Place a Hula-Hoop on one student’s arm and have them join hands with the student next to them. Ask all the other students to join hands to close up the circle. The objective of the game is to pass the Hula-Hoop all the way around the circle without unclasping hands. Students will have to figure out how to maneuver their bodies all the way through the hoop to pass it on. 20. Bumpity-ump-bump-bump This is a fun name game that requires quick thinking! Students stand in a large circle. One student comes to the middle. That student walks around the inside of the circle, stops in front of one person, and gives them a direction. There are four choices: Left = say the name of the person to the left; right = say the name of the person on the right; it = say the name of the person who is it; or self = say one’s own name. After you give the student the direction, the designated person says “bumpity-ump-bump-bump!” out loud. The student who was given the direction races to say the name of the correct person before the student finishes the phrase. If they can’t, they’re the next person on the inside of the circle. 21. Snakes In this challenging trust-building activity, blindfolded students line up with their hands on each others’ shoulders. A person without a blindfold takes the end position. The object of the activity is for the sighted person to guide the non-sighted students without verbal communication to collect various soft objects scattered on the floor. Once the lead person finds an object, they must deposit it in a bucket. Extra challenge: Students must keep their hands on each others’ shoulders at all times. 22. No-Hands Cup-Stacking Challenge If you’re looking for hands-on team-building games and activities that work for groups of kids, try this challenge. It’s an exercise in patience and perseverance, not to mention a total blast! Decide how many students you want in each group and tie that number of strings to a single rubber band, making one for each group. Each person in the group holds on to one of the strings attached to the rubber band, and, as a group, they use this device to pick up the cups (by expanding and contracting the rubber band) and place them on top of each other in order to build a pyramid. See detailed instructions here. 23. Mini Cup-Stacking Challenge And for younger students, this simplified version of the game allows kids to partner up one-on-one. Using just a few pipe cleaners and a rubber band, each student can take a hold and work together to create a stack. 24. Body Parts Students face off head-to-head in a squat position with a plastic cup on the ground between them. The leader calls out body parts and the players have to move their hands to that spot—head, knees, toes, eyes, nose, etc. But when they say “Cup!” the pair each tries to grab the cup. If they grab it, they remain in the game. The other player is “out” for the rest of the round. Also, if a student touches the cup when “Cup!” was not called, they are immediately out! So they need to listen carefully as the leader attempts to trick them into lunging toward to the cup. 25. Human Alphabet If you have a large open space for your team-building games and activities, try this idea. Have students spread out and guide them through a few rounds of forming letters with their bodies. For instance, “Use your body to make a T. … Now make an O!” Next, call out a simple short word, such as “so” or “dog.” Students will have to team up to form the word, with each student using their body to form one of the letters. Start with two-letter words, then three, then four. If students want more of a challenge, come up with a phrase that will take the whole class to complete. 26. Caterpillar Divide students into groups of four. Lay out four Hula-Hoops per group and have one student stand in the center of each one to form teams of “caterpillars.” Line all of the teams up at the end of a field or large open space. Set out four or five objects in front of the lines, such as cones, foam blocks, or balls. The goal of the game is to collect as many objects as possible by moving the caterpillar forward. To move forward, the last player in line steps into the hoop with the player in front of them, picks up their empty hoop, and passes it overhead to the front of the line. The front player then places the hoop on the ground in front of them and steps into it. Every player then shifts forward, moving the caterpillar. Only the front player may pick up objects, but it is the team’s job to carry the collected objects throughout the game. The game ends when there are no more objects on the ground. 27. Shrinking Vessel For this activity, you will need a few jump ropes. Divide students into groups of six or eight. Have each group make a circle with their jump rope (their “lifeboat”) on the ground so that the ends are touching. Now have all the members of each group get into their lifeboat. This should be easy the first time. Then have all players get out and reduce the size of their circle by one foot. Again, all players need to get into the boat. Repeat this process, making the lifeboat smaller and smaller while you watch your students come up with creative solutions for making sure that everyone fits safely inside their boat. 28. Pretzel, Unpretzel This is one of the all-time favorite team-building activities for kids. Divide your class in half and have each group choose one pretzel maker and two unpretzelers. Direct the unpretzelers to turn their backs. Have the rest of the students in each group form a circle and hold hands. Now, have the pretzel maker direct the students (with words only) to twist around, step over, and duck under each others’ arms to form a human pretzel. Once they are sufficiently twisted, call the unpretzelers over and have them try to direct the students (with words only) in order to untangle them. Students cannot drop their hands at any time. The first team that successfully unpretzels their group wins. 29. Zip, Zap, Boing! This super-lively circle game involves three actions—zip, zap, and boing. Zip directs play in one direction around the circle. Boing reverses the direction of play. And zap passes play to the opposite side of the circle. See the video above for a full demonstration. A couple of rules: Boing cannot be performed when someone passes the signal using zap. And zap cannot be passed to the person standing right next to you. 30. Spiderweb This team-building game will teach your students that even though they may be different in many ways, they are still connected to one another. Gather in a circle, standing or sitting. The game begins when the first person, holding a large ball of twine, tells the group a funny or embarrassing story about themselves. Once they finish, they hold on to the end of the twine and throw the ball to someone else in the circle. Play continues until the twine has been passed to each person. The end result will produce a “spiderweb” out of the twine, connecting each student to all of the others. 31. Team Tic-Tac-Toe This fun and active version of the old-fashioned game gets kids revved up about working as a team. Hula-Hoops are placed in the shape of a tic-tac-toe frame. Then students divide into teams and the race begins! One student from each team runs to the frame and drops a bean bag in a spot. They return and tag the next runner, who does the same thing. Play continues until one team achieves a tic-tac-toe! 32. Newspaper Fashion Show This is a great way to incorporate upcycling into your team-building games and activities. Divide students into groups of five or six, then give them a stack of newspapers, tape, and scissors. Set a timer and ask them to create the most fashionable outfit using only the supplies given. When time is up, have each group designate a model for the outfit, and have the group share information about the outfit. Once everyone shares, put on some rocking music and have a mini fashion show. 33. Back-to-Back Drawing Need team-building games and activities that build communication skills? Ask students to pair up and sit back-to-back with their partner. Give one student a blank piece of paper and a pen or a marker. Give the other student a piece of paper with a simple drawing on it. The kid who receives the illustration will verbally describe the drawing to their partner. The other kid must draw the illustration by listening to the verbal instructions alone. 34. Changing Tableau Ask for five or six volunteers to come up to the front of the class. Divide the rest of the students into two teams and have them sit together. Have the students up front arrange themselves into a tableau. Give the two teams a short time to observe the tableau, trying to memorize their physical arrangement. After a couple of minutes, ask every person on both teams to face away from the team up front. The tableau team will decide on one thing to change about the tableau. When they are rearranged, the teams can turn around and try to figure out what changed. The first team to spot the difference gets a point. Continue play until one team receives 10 points. 35. Straw Challenge If you’re looking for team-building games and activities for kids that require coordination and cooperation, try this one. Have your students form a large circle and give each one a plastic straw. The objective of the challenge is to balance each straw between one person’s right pointer finger with the left pointer finger of the person next to them. Try making some movements such as rotating the circle to the left or right, raising one foot, etc. The challenge is to keep the connection of straws intact. 36. Group Juggle Have students circle up and make sure you have a supply of small plastic balls at the ready. Start by tossing one ball from person to person in the circle. After a minute, add in another ball. Instruct students to mindfully toss the ball, avoiding a collision. After another minute, add in another ball. Continue adding balls each minute to see how many balls your students can successfully juggle. 37. Hula-Hoop Ring Toss Team members take turns tossing a Hula-Hoop over colored cones. Each color has a different point value. This game also incorporates math practice when adding your team’s score. 38. Great Chain Race For this team-building activity, students split up into groups of three or four. Each group gets one sheet of paper (a different color for each group), one pair of scissors, and one glue stick. The teams then cut their paper to make a paper chain that’s as long as possible—they might choose to make many skinny rings or cut up small rings to get as many rings from their paper as possible. In the end, lay out the paper chains the kids created and see whose is the longest. 39. Team Pen Working together, students try to create a drawing. Attach strings to a marker, however many you’d like. Have students each take one end and gather around a table. Together, they will need to communicate in order to manipulate the pen and draw the required image. 40. Knee Relay This raucous activity will have your students rolling on the floor with laughter. Using only their knees, players must take turns picking up oranges one at a time from the ground and transfer them to a hoop across the room. The team to transfer the most oranges in 60 seconds wins. Plus, you’ll have a juicy snack for everyone when you’re done. 41. Human Caterpillar Activity Students will work together to move a circle made of newspapers across the room. Before you begin, use strong tape to connect the sections of newspaper into a loop. To begin, students will step inside and move their feet and hands to help move the loop in the direction of the finish line, as shown in the video. The challenge is keeping pace with the students in front of them. The first team that is able to navigate their caterpillar to the finish line first is the winner. 42. Blind Minefield Looking for obstacle course team-building activities for kids? This fun and challenging activity requires communication, listening skills, and trust. Students will navigate through an obstacle course while blindfolded with the help of a partner who will call out directions. If the blindfolded student touches any of the objects in the minefield, their turn is over and another pair gives it a try. The team with the most players to make it through without touching any hazards wins. 43. Paper Tower Using creative problem-solving skills, each team of students must build the tallest tower possible with 20 sheets of plain computer paper. The tower must be stable enough to be measured. This activity is not only a great team-building activity, it’s a lot of fun! Do you have favorite go-to team-building activities for kids? Come share in our WeAreTeachers HELPLINE group on Facebook!

      "title": "5 Genshin Impact: Best Characters For Marechaussee Hunter Artifact Set - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "Equipping the ideal Genshin Impact characters with Marechaussee Hunter Artifacts is a strategic way of optimizing their Normal Attacks for increased damage output. The Marechaussee Hunter is one of the two new sets of Artifacts in Genshin Impact 4.0. This is the same update that will introduce players to the region of Fontaine, also known as the Nation of Justice. This area of Teyvat is led by the new Hydro Archon called Focalors, though she rules under the guise of a mortal vessel named Furina. In this new region, players will be able to obtain the Marechaussee Hunter Artifacts for their characters. While the Golden Troupe Artifact set in Genshin Impact is made for sub-DPS characters that operate even when they are off-field, the Marechaussee Hunter set is made for DPS heroes that rely on Normal Attacks as their main source of damage, according to leaks. With two pieces, it boosts Normal and Charged Attack DMG by 15%. Its four-piece bonus increases CRIT Rate by 11% for five seconds whenever the Genshin Impact character equipping Marechaussee Hunter suffers HP fluctuation, either through HP loss or healing. This effect can be stacked up to three times. With this, it is easy to determine which are the best characters for the new Artifact set. Related: Genshin Impact 4.0: How To Get Lynette For Free 5 Lyney According to Lyney’s leaked gameplay kit in Genshin Impact 4.0, the 5-star archer from Fontaine suffers HP loss via Charged Attacks to increase his own performance, making him a viable candidate for the new Marechaussee Hunter set. In fact, it seems as if this Artifact set is made for him. Lyney’s main source of damage is actually provided by his Normal Attacks. In fact, at C3, he gets a 3-level boost to Normal Attacks, which is a novelty in the open-world action RPG. While in combat, Lyney’s main focus will be dealing damage through his Normal and Charged Attacks and, while at it, he will be consuming HP. This HP consumption method will grant Lyney stacks of Prop Surplus, which will then empower his Elemental Skill, Bewildering Lights. This Skill regenerates his HP and his Energy, while also triggering the explosion of his Grin-Malkin Hat prop created by his tier 2 Charged Attacks – the damage dealt by the explosion triggered by the Elemental Skill is considered a Charged Attack, further making him benefit from equipping four pieces of the set. The Fontaine magician is easily one of the best characters to equip the Marechaussee Hunter Artifacts in Genshin Impact as they work hand-in-hand with his core gameplay loop. 4 Dehya Another good Genshin Impact character to use the Marechaussee Hunter Artifact set is Dehya. The mercenary from Sumeru’s main source of damage can be confusing as her entire gameplay kit is somewhat unstable. In spite of that, she does deal a great amount of damage through her empowered Normal and Charged Attacks. This means she can take advantage of the two-piece bonus in a very straightforward manner. In addition to that, Dehya can also endure HP loss through her Redmane’s Blood passive ability, which makes her take in damage for any characters hit by attacks within her Fiery Sanctum field. In fact, Dehya is incentivized to lose HP in Genshin Impact, as she gains a buff to her resistance to interruption, allowing her to strike opponents seamlessly, even while they attack her. She does not prompt the HP loss herself, but Dehya operates on the field with both a high max HP count for skill-scaling purposes and the incentive to lose HP to keep the combat rolling. This exact gameplay loop, combined with the Marechaussee Hunter set’s four-piece bonus that boosts damage output via HP loss is what makes her an ideal character for the new Artifacts. 3 Ayato Kamisato Ayato Kamisato is yet another great character for the Marechaussee Hunter Artifacts in Genshin Impact. The 5-star swordsman from Inazuma is extremely reliant on his Normal Attack, as his Elemental Skill empowers his regular strikes for both increased damage and Hydro application. With the two-piece bonus, Ayato can see his damage output via Normal Attacks significantly increase. In fact, this bonus goes well in hand with his entire build. Currently, his best Artifact set is Echoes of an Offering, which boosts his ATK% and his Normal Attack DMG. With Marechaussee Hunter, Ayato gets another solid option to equip. In addition to that, Ayato’s build in Genshin Impact prompts him to have a huge HP pool, as his stronger abilities scale off that stat. Because of this, he can also take advantage of the HP loss mechanic provided by the four-piece bonus from the Marechaussee Hunter set. Much like Dehya, he cannot trigger his own HP loss, and will instead rely on being hit by opponents to get a boost to CRIT Rate. Nevertheless, with the aforementioned HP pool, Ayato can safely allow himself to take a few hits and, after dealing damage, be cured by the healer, which will then activate the bonus again. 2 Xiao A classic Genshin Impact character to use with the Marechaussee Hunter Artifact set is Xiao. The adeptus from Liyue’s main source of damage does not come from his regular Normal and Charged Attacks, but through empowered versions of them when he triggers his Elemental Burst. By equipping the set, Xiao can see a significant increase to his damage output due to the two-piece bonus. In addition to this, Xiao is a character that prompts his own HP loss via his Elemental Burst, which means he will easily trigger the four-piece bonus provided by the Marechaussee Hunter Artifact set. As a main DPS character that relies heavily on a decent CRIT DMG and CRIT Rate distribution, the Marechaussee Hunter Artifacts may provide the extra boost to CRIT Rate Xiao needs when he starts losing HP because of his Elemental Skill. He should also have the bonus up and running when he is being healed, which makes Xiao a great candidate for the Marechaussee Hunter Artifacts in Genshin Impact. It is important to note that Xiao has better sets to equip, but depending on how players plan on using him, the new Artifacts from Version 4.0 may actually make sense. 1 Hu Tao Hu Tao follows Lyney’s steps and is the second-best character to equip the Marechaussee Hunter Artifact set. The Pyro polearm user from Liyue excels at dealing damage with her Normal and Charged Attacks, thus taking great advantage of the set’s two-piece bonus. What is most important, however, is how much the character’s HP fluctuates with Hu Tao’s best build in Genshin Impact. She prompts her own HP loss with her Elemental Skill to empower her regular attacks with Pyro damage. With the Marechaussee Hunter set, she will get a fantastic boost to CRIT Rate, which is indispensable to her as a DPS hero. Another great aspect about pairing up Hu Tao with the Marechaussee Hunter Artifacts it is that, even with the HP loss and her life at around 50%, her maximum HP pool should be so high that she will still be safe. In a sense, Hu Tao benefits from the same advantage that Ayato Kamisato has: abilities that scale off HP. Hu Tao already has a solid build, but the new Marechaussee Hunter Artifact set can change things up for her in Genshin Impact.",

      "title": "Superconductor Superconfusion, KOSA’s Hidden Costs and HatGPT",
      "text": "This transcript was created using speech recognition software. While it has been reviewed by human transcribers, it may contain errors. Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions. I’m sweaty. Is my sweat showing up on cam? Yeah. The live chat is going wild about it. [LAUGHS]: They’re saying, somebody cool this guy down. Gang, gang. Mmm, ice cream so good. Did you see somebody sent me a video yesterday? It’s just like an old German man saying that. Anyways. I really hope that we become MPC streamers. Oh, let’s — How funny would that be? Mmm, “Hard Fork” so good. “Hard Fork” so good. [MUSIC PLAYING] I’m Kevin Roose, tech columnist at “The New York Times.” I’m Casey Newton from Platformer. And you’re listening to “Hard Fork.” This week on the show — the hunt for the mythical room-temperature superconductor, then the Kids Online Safety Act. It might make teens safer, but will it break the internet in the process? And finally, our favorite game returns — it’s time for HatGPT. So Casey. Mhmm. It’s sort of a slow news week out there. Not going to lie. We can’t start the opening block of the show by saying it’s been a slow news week. I’d like to be honest with our listeners. I hope you’re just trying to lower people’s expectations so that you can overdeliver. Yes. OK. Well, so what I was going to say is that it has been a pretty slow news week in tech except for the possible discovery of room-temperature superconductors. Let’s get into it. So Casey, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but tons of tech people, basically the same people who have been very into crypto and very into AI and tweeting about both of those topics for years, have been obsessing over the past week with this possible maybe discovery of something called a room-temperature superconductor. What do you know about this story? OK. What I know about it is very little. I would not describe myself as a science person. When it comes to matters of material science usually I just think, well, that’s none of my business. And if it becomes important to me, someone will tell me about it. But it seems like maybe we’ve arrived at that point. Well, we might have arrived at that point. OK. So I want to bracket all of this discussion that we’re about to have with a disclaimer that there is still a chance that all of this is garbage, is not real, but — By the way, big theme on “Hard Fork”— big chance that all of this is garbage, but go on. [LAUGHS]: But I think it’s really fascinating that this has attracted so much interest in the tech world. People like Sam Altman have been tweeting about it, all these science hobbyists and venture capitalists. A surprising chunk of the internet seems to be suddenly obsessed with superconductors. So I feel like we should talk about what is going on and why these people are so fired up. So, OK, let’s start with a little science lesson, Casey. So what do you know about electrical transmission? What I know about electrical transmission is that when you transmit electricity, you lose some of it as it gets from place to place. Correct. So if you think about electricity moving through a wire, there’s a current flowing that experiences friction because electrons bump into vibrating atoms. Yeah, like you know when you’re making wine and some of the wine evaporates, and they call that the angel’s share? They do? They do. That’s what they call it. That’s very poetic. Isn’t that very poetic? Well, so what you’re saying is that there’s an angel share of electricity transmission. Exactly. So some amount of the electricity that you put through a wire is lost. When your phone gets hot when you use it a lot, that is because there is resistance. There is an imperfect transmission of electricity happening, and some of that electricity is being wasted as heat. You know what else it’s like? It’s like, you’re ever having a conversation with a romantic partner, and they’re sort of not getting it? It’s because 5 percent to 10 percent of what you’re trying to say has actually been lost in transit. So there’s a lot of parallels for this in our world. Exactly. So for more than a century, scientists have been very interested in what we call superconductors, which are materials that conduct electricity perfectly with no loss or waste whatsoever. And we have actually discovered some — I say “we” because I play a huge role in this discovery, based on reading several thousand tweets about it and some Wikipedia articles. So basically, there are materials that if you take them down to minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit, or even colder than that sometimes, they can become superconductors. They transmit electricity with no loss. But that’s not really that useful because how many situations do you have where you have the ability to cool something down to these extremely cold temperatures? The only thing that cold in 2023 is the crypto industry. So, very limited use cases for that. So for the past several decades, scientists have been chasing this dream of a superconductor that works at room temperature, where you could just sort of make a wire out of something and have it be in a device or on a power line, and it would just work and you would have no waste, no loss, in the system. So it’s like if Silly Putty turned out to be a superconductor. That would be great because it’s shelf stable. You don’t have to do anything to protect it. You just sprinkle a little bit of it on whatever you want. Out of all the materials you could have chosen as your example, I’m fascinated that Silly Putty made it at the top of the list. Well, because that’s what I think of as like a vaguely scientific space age material. You know? It’s like that was sort of the last great advance in material science was Silly Putty. It’s true. OK, so here is what is happening in the world of material science. Last week, these two academic articles showed up on Archive, which is a platform for what they call preprints, which are basically things that have not been peer reviewed, but that people can go and look at. And one of them had the sort of offputting and academic title, “Superconductor PB10XCUXP0460”— Wait, Kevin, that’s my Hulu password. [LAUGHS]: —“Showing Levitation at Room Temperature and Atmospheric Pressure and Mechanism.” The other one had a much better — some social media editor got their hands on this one. And it had an attention grabbing title called, “The First Room Temperature Ambient Pressure Superconductor.” There we go. Now that’s a preprint title. Now we’re cooking. Yeah. So both of these preprints came from a group of researchers at the Quantum Energy Research Center in Seoul, who claimed to have identified what they call LK-99, which is a room temperature ambient pressure superconductor, basically a material that can work as a superconductor not only at room temperature, but in sort of normal pressure situations. This is this holy grail that researchers have been chasing for decades. And what’s also really unusual about this is that their sort of process seems strangely simple. Scientists have sort taken for granted for many years that if we ever did discover one of these room temperature superconductors, it would involve some crazy rare earth metal or some process that made it very hard to produce. Yeah, it’s like whenever they discover a new element of the periodic table, it’s like they’re bouncing 45 lasers off of these — or met inside of a super collider, right? And it only exists for 0.1 seconds. That’s how we make new things in this world. Totally. And actually, a funny story. So do you remember the first “Avatar” movie? I’ll never forget it. There was this thing called unobtainium. Unobtainium was a room temperature superconductor. And it cost trillions of dollars. It was the most valuable material on the Earth, which is why they had to go to Pandora to get it. And wipe out the Na’vi. Yes. Yeah. Wait, I mean, how far ahead is James Cameron thinking? That man is living in the year 3,000. What a year he’s having, between the superconductor and the submersible stuff. Yeah, so we assumed that this would be very expensive to produce if we ever found it. These Korean researchers, they appear to have done this with very conventional processes. It seems almost too simple. Now can you say anything about what these materials are or what the process — like, I’m trying to imagine this LK-99. Can I hold it in my hand? Is it in a vial of some sort? Is a Bunsen burner involved? What’s happening here? Well, I’m glad you asked, Casey. So it turns out that this recipe that they basically put in this paper includes fairly common chemical elements, things like lead, sulfate, copper, and phosphorous. They go through the step-by-step process. It involves mixing things in a ceramic crucible, heating things in a furnace at 725 degrees Celsius. Now that is hotter than your oven will typically go at your home. It is, yes. Yeah, you’re going to need one of those fancy pizza ovens to replicate this in your home. You’ve got to mix some lanarkite with some CU3P, things that I definitely know what they are. And eventually, you sort of mix all this stuff together, bake it at a really high temperature, do a few more steps like this, and then it turns into a superconductor. So the other fun thing about this is that these researchers, in addition to putting up this paper with this sort of recipe in it, they also show off a video. Now, can I show you this video? Yeah, I’ll see it. Can you see this video? OK. I’ll play this video for you. And I want you to describe what you’re seeing in this video. OK. There is a sort of metallic disk, and some sort of material has been placed onto it. It looks kind of like a little — like a chip, almost. And it’s floating. Oh, it is floating. It’s floating. A little bit of it is touching, but it’s floating. Yeah, it looks almost like a magnet. And so what we’re looking at, that is LK-99. That is LK-99. So — OK, so it is actually something — you could hold it in your hand. Yes, so it’s a little complicated, but basically, if something is a superconductor, it produces something called the Meissner effect. Now we’re getting into — Can I just say, every week you’re asking me about, have I ever heard of this effect or this conundrum or this postulate? And it’s become one of my favorite things of the show. So anyway, yeah, please tell me about the Meissner effect. So when something is a superconductor, basically, it levitates. When exposed to a magnet, when exposed to a magnet, it hovers above the magnet. And this is the principle behind sort of Maglev trains and things like that. So this video that these South Korean researchers put out shows a little pellet of LK-99 kind of expelling a magnetic field, which they say is sort of a telltale sign of superconductivity. So that is the claim, that these Korean researchers have figured out this holy grail in material science. And these papers, this claim by this group of Korean researchers, has totally lit this particular corner of the internet that I am in on fire. There’s a subreddit called r/Singularity, which is usually talking about AI and scientific progress and stuff, which has just been totally taken over by posts about LK-99 and videos of people claiming to replicate these findings and discussions of what the implications could be if this is real. There’s actually been a prediction market about whether this experiment will be replicated. And what are people saying? Well, right now, on Manifold Markets, so the question that people are betting on is, will the LK-99 room temp ambient pressure superconductivity preprint replicate before 2025? And right now, the market says that there is a 36 percent chance that this will happen. OK, so a significant chance, but the betting money is still against it. Well, yes. Researchers are sort of — I’m saying researchers, but most of the people betting on this stuff — Degenerate gamblers. Degenerate gamblers believe that there is a 36 percent chance that this will replicate in the next two years. In addition to the degenerate gamblers, there are also just a ton of Discord channels and Telegram channels where this is being discussed. And on Twitter, these people with previously very small presences have just been gaining tons and tons of followers because they’re doing all these threads about how LK-99 will change everything, and here’s the investment strategy that you need. Here’s how you can use LK-99 to advance in your career. Right, right, exactly. Right, the LinkedIn thread boys have arrived. It’s sort of just this vigilante science movement that has cropped up online, not only to follow along with what’s going on, but just to speculate about what it all means. And I’m sure you’ve seen these sort of experiments where people are trying to recreate this thing, to replicate the results of this experiment. There’s at least — Wait, wait, wait. Is there like a viral TikTok challenge or something? [LAUGHS]: Sort of, almost. There is a guy who has been live streaming his attempt to replicate LK-99 on Twitch. That’s amazing. There’s another — this one, I’m really obsessed with. There is an account on Twitter, Iris_IGB, who is like a Russian scientist with an anime girl avatar, who claims that she is making her own samples of LK-99 in her kitchen. Wow. So she does have an oven hot enough. Well, it may be that she has actually modified her oven in some way that is extremely unsafe to be able to get it to these high temperatures. And she’s not following along with the exact instructions laid out in this Korean preprint. Well, look, if you’re making LK-99 at home, part of the fun is putting your own spin on it. Exactly. A little cumin, a little garlic powder here. You know, who needs to measure? Basically, this has become like a folk science project that the sort of internet scientists and sleuths are throwing themselves into because in their minds, this would be a game changing innovation if it were actually real. And it has sort of become a moment where the buttoned up world of white lab coat material science sort of merges with the weird fandoms of the internet and makes this weird and crazy thing. I mean, material scientists must be so excited that the spotlight is shining on their industry, and there’s now a wellspring of people rising up to learn about what they do. I would say yes and no. I mean, the materials scientists that I have seen reacting to this are sort of like, we have a process for replicating things like this. There is a scientific method. Like, we need to — There’s a woman in Russia she’s got an oven. We got to get some time with her. [LAUGHING]:: So they’re basically like, let’s just before we get too excited, before we start proclaiming that our new technological utopia of superconductors has arrived, let’s actually check out the science and make sure it works. Now you may be asking yourself, why does this matter? That was exactly what I was asking myself. So if this is true, it is a potentially transformative innovation because what you could do, if you actually had a room temperature ambient pressure superconductor, is, you could replace all the power lines in the world with this material, and all of a sudden, your whole energy grid gets more efficient. You could also have vastly better things, like charging. Your devices could charge almost instantaneously. They wouldn’t get hot when you use them too much. It would also, apparently, be a very big deal for things like quantum computers, which I’ve been on the record on this show saying, I think quantum computers are fake. But maybe this will make them real. But maybe this can make them real. And basically, this would be a huge breakthrough that would mean that essentially all of our electrical infrastructure could be rebuilt in a much more efficient way. Wow. So that would be, obviously, hugely consequential. I’m sure we would be talking about that a lot more on the show, but my assumption is because — well, everything that you described, Kevin, it frankly sounds a little bit too good to be true. It does. And so one of the interesting things is that even though these preprints are going viral on the internet, and actually, there are some scientists who do think that we should be pursuing trying to confirm these findings, there are scientists in some of the relevant fields who are not as excited. They’ve got misgivings about the data, the way it was presented. I’ve seen some going as far as to say that these preprints are not serious. And basically, we shouldn’t be paying attention to them. So in general, I would say that the scientific community is approaching these findings with curiosity, but also a lot of skepticism, which is understandable because there hasn’t been a successful replication of these findings from a reputable lab. And there have been several other instances in recent years, including one just this year, of scientists claiming to have identified a room temperature superconductor, and then later having to walk their claims back. Now here’s a question. Have we asked ChatGPT whether this is a real superconductor? [LAUGHS]: I did ask ChatGPT and Claude to analyze the LK-99 research and tell me whether they thought it was legitimate or not. They have no idea. They’re just making stuff up. So let’s just stipulate what we’ve stipulated, which is that this may be bogus. This may not be real. It is fascinating to me how the internet has latched onto this. And look, I mean, I like this part of the internet, right? Like, people coming together around something that could be positive, you love to see it. There was a time when average people did not have access to preprint papers on the internet, right? You had to have an academic library access, something like that. Now, with Archive, there is so much research available to people. And yes, it is not peer reviewed, which means there’s a lot more stuff out there that isn’t going to hold up under scrutiny. But it gives access to average people who might have an interest or a background in it to say, you know what? Let’s tear this apart. Let’s see what we can make of this. Yeah, let’s crank up the old oven, and let’s start making some LK-99 in the kitchen. Now, is it dangerous to make LK-99? Do we need to put like a content advisory on this? Yeah, I mean I would say, I am not going to be trying to fabricate my own LK-99. I can’t even bake sourdough. So I’m not going to be attempting this in my own kitchen. I would also recommend that our listeners, unless you are a material scientist or Russian anime girls, not try to do this at home. But I also think this is exciting. I hope this is real. I want to believe. I think it would be very exciting. I think we do need scientific breakthroughs. And I actually think it is good for people to be sort of interested in this stuff at a citizen level, right? I want kids growing up thinking, I want to discover a superconductor, because that is the kind of thing that actually could make our world better. At the same time, the other side of this that makes me slightly nervous is that when you do have all of these sort of citizen scientists on the internet looking at preprints and doing experiments in their kitchens, I also think that undermines trust in the scientific establishment. And I’m old enough to remember the long ago year of 2021, when a bunch of people on the internet got really excited about these bogus miracle cures for COVID, right? They were looking at the preprints, showing that maybe ivermectin was the cure for COVID. Maybe hydroxychloroquine was the magic bullet that was finally going to prevent this awful pandemic. And the same kind of phenomenon emerged where, on very little evidence, with very little support from the scientific establishment, these sort of renegade Twitter scientists just started getting all kinds of clout for making these outlandish — and it turns out completely false — claims about these COVID cures. And it just really did set us back as a country and as a society. So I’m wondering, do you think that the positives of this kind of citizen engagement with science outweigh the negatives? I think so. I mean, maybe we need to develop better filtering mechanisms. I don’t think the issue was necessarily that people wanted to study whether ivermectin could be helpful. It was more that after there started to be evidence that it wasn’t, Joe Rogan still had on a controversial doctor saying, actually, it cured my COVID or whatever. So I think it’s much more about how we direct attention to people after we have learned that what they were saying was probably not true. The scientific process is always going to be full of people getting things wrong, right? The whole scientific journey is this very iterative path. And there’s just going to be a lot of stuff that isn’t true that we learn along the way. So what I would say is, basically, no, I’m not worried about a bunch of people getting really interested in science and doing experiments and doing analysis, because the alternative is watching Bravo or playing “Fortnite.” You have some spare time? You want to do science? Do some damn science. I don’t know. See, I want to agree with you because I want to open up science to the masses. I want people to be interested in it. I even want people to be trying weird stuff, as long as it’s safe, in their own homes. But I would just say, ask the immunologists and the public health officials during COVID if they would rather have done their response in a world with no social media. And the answer that you may have gotten from them is yes, that they actually do feel like social media and the citizen interest and the preprints and the mass availability of not only good information about the virus and the responses to the virus, but a lot of bad information, actually did make their jobs and their lives harder, so. That’s true, but there was also a point where that same establishment was saying, hey, don’t bother wearing a mask — it’s not going to help. Right? And it was people on social media saying, this doesn’t make any sense to us. Right. So Casey, we’ve been very careful and sort of responsible in talking about this. But — Incredibly responsible. I just want to ask you the question. Do you think this is real? Do you think the rocks float? Do you think LK-99 is real? And do you think that we are all going to be riding around in Maglev trains and charging our phones in two minutes? Kevin, I have no idea. Like, absolutely not. People probably wonder, why do people start a podcast? It’s so they can sound smart talking about things. I cannot sound smart talking about this. Like, everything that you’ve just said, I would have probably gotten a C minus in if I had to take an exam in it in high school physics. Yeah, I mean, I feel the same way. I am by no means an expert on this topic. But I did spend the vast majority of the past couple of days learning about superconductors, which is not something — So after your two days of research, you’re a materials expert. Yeah, I am now an expert. I’m ready to be a thread boy. I am — I like that you’re like, it’s so dangerous when the public embraces these new scientific trends and spouts off at the mouth, but that said, after 48 hours of Wikipedia, I’m prepared to make my statement. Except for me. Yeah, except for you. My favorite tweet about this, by the way, was from someone called India Venom, who said, if LK-99 proves to be a replicable superconductor, then it may become possible to have two or more tabs open in Chrome without plugging your laptop in. [CHUCKLING] And my favorite tweet about it was the person who said that the only superconductor they knew was Lydia Tár. [LAUGHING]: [MUSIC PLAYING] When we come back, the controversy around a new bill that backers say will protect kids, critics say could break the internet. Kevin, it’s time to talk about a bill sitting up on Capitol Hill. Have you heard of the Kids Online Safety Act? Well, I had not. And then you told me that you wanted to talk about it on the show this week so I studied up. So I now know just enough to be dangerous about the Kids Online Safety Act. And I’m excited to talk about it because I think it actually is quite important. Yeah, well, one of the things we’ve talked about over the past few months is how nervous we ought to be about the effects of the internet on children and mental health. There is a mental health crisis among young people in this country. And this year, the surgeon general issued an advisory saying that social media use can lead to bad mental health outcomes for some kids. So when you have a finding like that, the general thing you want to see is Congress to do something about it, right? You want the lawmakers to come together and figure out, OK, well, if there’s some sort of harm here, how can we mitigate it? And one of the things that Congress is trying is this Kids Online Safety Act, KOSA. KOSA is, I think, how people are referring to it online. You may see that if you’re browsing the internet. And what makes it interesting for our purposes is, one, last week, lawmakers voted to send it to the floor, but two, unlike almost all of the other attempts to regulate big tech over the past half a decade or so, this one has a lot of co-sponsors, I believe 43 co-sponsors in the Senate. So this could actually happen. This could actually become law. It is a bipartisan group that is rooting for it. And so I think it’s just kind of time to take a look at what it does because in the end — and we’ll get into this — I think this bill could stop us from being able to use the internet in the ways we want to. Right, and I wanna also say that KOSA, this bill, appears to have crossed some threshold where people actually know what it is and care about what it is. I’ve been seeing TikToks where people are talking about their takes on this bill and how it would affect the internet. And it sort of feels like — do you remember when FOSTA and SESTA, and before that, SOPA and PIPA were these other bills that were like, lots of people started caring about them all of a sudden and writing angry letters to their congresspeople. And it sort of became a mainstream-ish concern. And that feels like it’s happening with KOSA. Also, don’t FOSTA, SESTA, SOPA, and PIPA sound like a Norwegian family? Just like a beautiful, beautiful family. [LAUGHING]: But anyway, so what would this bill do? One of the big pillars is that the bill says that platforms will now have what they call a duty of care to prevent and mitigate various harms. And those harms include mental health disorders, eating disorders, bullying, harassment, sexual exploitation, drugs, deceptive marketing practices — all things that we can agree are bad, right? Like we don’t want minors to be exposed to these things. Correct, yeah. But what does duty of care actually do? It sounds good, and you want the platforms to feel a duty to care about this stuff. But is that like a legal phrase? It is, but you’ve hit on what is the real challenge here, which is that what this law would ask platforms to do is to guess in advance which speech on their platforms might harm people in the future. And that’s just extraordinarily difficult to do, right? Some kids might see eating disorders content and develop an eating disorder. Other kids might see that content and think, oh, gosh, that seems like a really bad thing. I’ve been educated about this thing, and I am going to avoid it. The platform is not going to be able to predict that in advance. And one of the real issues here is the way that this law takes this “one size fits all” approach to trying to protect teens when kids are individuals, and they have all sorts of circumstances that may inform how they react to content they see online. So it basically opens up legal liability for platforms. They can be sued if minors encounter certain types of harmful content on their service that leads them to do harmful things. Yeah, that’s right. It empowers the Federal Trade Commission to take action against these platforms by forcing them to change in some way. And then it also lets state attorneys general sue these platforms if they feel like any of their residents have been harmed. So let’s put a pin in that because I think that is really important. And that’s something that I imagine we’ll come back to because that is one of the pieces about this that worries me. But there’s also other stuff in this KOSA bill. So what else does this bill do? So the other big thing is that, well, if you’re going to try to hold platforms accountable for their effects on young people, you need to know who on the platform is a young person. And you need to mandate somehow that platforms identify young users on their platform, right? If you want to protect them, you have to know who these users are. When this bill was first being discussed, it required the platforms to verify the ages of their users. And this has a lot of privacy harms for average people, right? Because teenagers and adults use the same websites, in many cases. And so that doesn’t just mean that if you’re a kid, you’re going to have to prove that you’re 17 in order to access some website. It means that all adults are going to have to prove that they are adults to access the websites that they are already using. And how are they going to do that? Well, we only have so many easy ways to verify our identity. We have driver’s licenses, but then how many private companies do you want to have to upload a full copy of your driver’s license to? So Congress gets a lot of criticism for this measure, and they come back and essentially, they just make it more vague. And they say, essentially, well, to the best of your ability, platforms, you need to guess a user’s age. But the very strong implication is that we’re going to put pressure on you to know the ages of your users. And if you’re serving up content that we think is inappropriate for younger users to see, then you are legally liable. So they moved from this very explicit thing, which was bad, to this kind of vague, wink, wink, nudge, nudge. Right. Another piece of the KOSA bill that I found interesting is this idea of parental controls. From what I understand, and correct me if I’m wrong, but the bill basically says that if you are a platform that is used by minors, you have to build in parental controls so that parents can say, my child can only interact with this app or this service in these ways. You can turn off things like messaging. You can limit their time in the app. Basically, the controls that you would get over something like Netflix for your kids’ account. All services with minors on them have to have those built-in protections. And to me, that actually sounds like a reasonable idea, but there are people who are very upset about this. So why is that? Well, I think the main reason is that there are going to be some kids, particularly in minority groups, who are going to be seeking content that they don’t necessarily want their parents to know about. And look, I agree with you. I think parents should obviously have a lot of control over what their kids are seeing, particularly at younger ages. But once you’re 14, 15, or 16, I do think you have some right to autonomy. And if you are a young LGBT person, you want to connect with other folks like you online. And you have parents who are very anti-LGBT. That could potentially put you at risk. And one of the points in that Surgeon General’s advisory was that a lot of these same kids can benefit greatly from finding that community online. It can actually improve their mental health. And so the danger is that we’re going to overpolice what is on the phones of teenagers in a way that will make some of them less safe. I can see that. That makes sense. So let’s go back to this piece about the FTC and state attorneys general being able to go after platforms and content providers on the internet over this sort of harmful content because this is an area where I actually do think the criticisms of this bill make a lot of sense to me. So just explain what that means and how this could be weaponized. Sure. So let me tell you a scenario that I think is extremely likely to happen if this law were to be passed. The Heritage Foundation is this right-wing group. They will essentially lobby for someone to sue the platforms for exposing minors to content involving transgender people. And in the view of the Heritage Foundation, that is a harm for a young person to know that trans people exist. And so they will go out and they will find a Republican attorney general. And that attorney general will sue the platforms, saying you have exposed the children of this state to this harmful content. And then that will become a big legal case, right? And well, you might be saying that will probably be thrown out. This clearly seems like an unconstitutional restriction on speech rights. But you have to remember just the chilling effect that this sort of thing has on these platforms. These are corporations. They are incentivized to avoid litigation, to avoid negative headlines. They want to avoid being in these kinds of fights. So it might not take that many of these attorneys general to come forward and to file these lawsuits before these platforms just really start cracking down on the kinds of things that you can say online, right? So the overall effect of this, even though I do think that there are some good intentions here to protect children, to address this mental health crisis, I really do think that the end result of it is, it’s going to be harder for you and me to discuss things online. It’s going to be a restriction on our speech rights. And there are just a lot more of us adults than there are of children. Right, and I also think there’s a big difference between a 13-year-old and a 16-year-old. I remember when I was 16, yeah, I was interested in looking at stuff on the internet, some of which my parents probably wouldn’t have approved of, right? It was not all puppies and rainbows and homework assignments. And I think that’s OK. And I think that if I had lived in a world where this bill was in effect, it still would have been possible for — I would have found a way around it because I was a little hacker kid, and I loved finding ways around the restrictions on my school’s internet, for example. But I think it would have just been a deterrent. And I think ultimately, that would have been bad for me. I do think there is a difference in emotional maturity between a 13-year-old and a 16-year-old. At the same time, you and I have talked on this show many times about how much of a minefield social media especially is for young people and how harmful it can be. And I do want Congress to do something about that. The problem is, when you allow the government to police speech on internet platforms or to go after tech companies for making certain types of content available, you also enable the kind of speech restriction and chilling effects on other types of content. It’s hard to come up with a bill that allows for education about eating disorders on social media that does not also allow attorneys general to try to take down content about what they called, quote, “gender ideology,” or trans people, essentially. Yeah, I agree with you. One place I would like to see the government act is just to invest in more research about this. I think that while there is a growing body of research around the questions of teens and social media, I don’t think that we have much that is particularly conclusive. And it just makes me worried that we don’t fully understand the problem here. It also definitely seems the case that some kinds of content are harmful for some people and just totally innocuous to others. And I just think it’s really hard to design laws around that. And I don’t want to be the person that says like, well, because this bill has one flaw in it, we have to all throw up our hands and do nothing. But I don’t know. Take a step back. There is a real war on speech in this country. Look at what is happening in the libraries of this country. Look at what is happening in the school curriculums in this country, right? Republicans are trying to just eliminate vast amounts of speech from the public square. And so when Democrats team up with those same Republicans to try to “protect kids”— and I’m sort of putting that in air quotes, but the main effect of that is it’s just going to be harder to talk politics online. I think you want to be really, really careful about that and ask whether there’s any other path to get to protecting those kids. I mean, I think what the designers of this bill did right is call it the Kids Online Safety Act. Oh, yes. I mean, if you just say that something is protecting the children, it’s very hard to argue with that. And actually, Joe Biden himself came out recently and urged Congress to pass this bill because something called the Kids Online Safety Act, if you’re a congressperson or a lawmaker who doesn’t study this stuff for a living, you just say, yeah. Who’s against protecting kids on the internet? I will say, after reading the full text of the proposed bill, there are a couple parts of it that I actually thought were good ideas. And so I think we should call that out in the interest of fairness. I don’t think this is all bad. There was a part about transparency and allowing researchers access to data from the platforms about how minors are using their products. I’m very into that. I think that’s a good idea. I think limiting data collection and ad targeting aimed at minors is a good idea. And I do like this parental controls thing. I mean, one of the things, my kid is not of internet using age yet, but when he is, I will want to know what he is doing on the internet for some amount of time. When he’s 16, maybe I’ll care less. But when he’s 11, 12, 13, 14, that is going to be information that I want, and I will want easy and sort of intuitive ways that are built into the systems themselves to be able to see and control what he’s able to do. So I actually think that is a good idea. I think that should be limited to platforms above a certain size. I mean, one thing that you typically see in internet regulation bills is that there are sort of rules that kick in only after you have 50 million users or 100 million users. To my knowledge, this KOSA bill does not do that. So a platform with 50,000 users would have to follow the same rules as Facebook and Instagram, which just seems burdensome for the smaller companies. Mike Masnick has this great blog called Techdirt, actually profiled in the past week in “The New York Times” by Kashmir Hill — really great story. And he’s been writing a ton about KOSA. It very much shaped my own thinking. And one of the things he’s written about is, I don’t want to have to collect age verification information from everyone who wants to come read my blog, you know? But that is the risk here, that just people, honest entrepreneurs like Mike and myself, just trying to run little websites, it’s like, well, you got to prove that you’re 14 to read my little blog about tech policy? It just feels silly. But when Platformer does hit 100 million subscribers, I think that should be subject to just excruciating amounts of regulation and compliance. And — Look, I already have to deal with the California Franchise Tax Board, and trust me, that’s more than enough torture for any one person. [LAUGING]:: OK, so in conclusion, I think we’re both agreed that KOSA, as it is currently written, is not a great example of internet regulation, and that it actually poses some real risks if it were to be passed. And I want to say one more thing, which is there is a kind of magical thinking, and it goes something like this. If we could just pull the plug out of the back of Facebook and TikTok and YouTube and all these other social platforms, the world would be restored to a pristine state. Our politics would be healed. Mental health issues would disappear. And we’d just sort of be living in utopia. And I just think that the evidence shows that’s probably not the case. In the past week, we saw four big studies released, and this was a bunch of researchers who’d gotten access to data from Facebook during the 2020 election. And they tweaked people’s newsfeeds in various ways to show them more politics or less politics, or we’re going to show you reshares or we’re not going to show you reshares. And the big question that they took into that was, well, can you affect people’s political beliefs based on what they’re seeing in the newsfeed, right? And that’s the spirit of so many of these regulations, is that what is in your timeline is destiny. What do they find? Very small effects, for the most part. Now, these studies are limited in some ways. They have their flaws. We need to see more of them, and that’s kind of a separate conversation. But when I see that sort of thing, I apply the lesson to something like KOSA, which is do not believe for a second that if you just change the content on TikTok, that the teen mental health crisis is going to disappear. These are situations that there are just so many connected systems here. And while I hate that argument, because it feels like what I’m really telling people to do is to throw up their hands and do nothing, I also don’t want people to get away with getting rid of a bunch of speech on the internet in this phony pursuit of a utopia that is just never going to arrive. See, I disagree. I don’t think it is a phony pursuit of utopia. I think it is people who are freaking out about something that is really, really affecting kids and their mental health. I think that the problem is real. I think that there are probably solutions that are more narrow and specific and less sweeping and broad than the ones proposed in KOSA. But I don’t think this is a fake problem. I think that when I see the tech companies lobbying to kill stuff like this, it actually makes me think, well, maybe there’s something there because they wouldn’t be worried if it was just a total garbage bill. Well, they’re worried about the massive legal bills that are going to stem out of it. Of course, but I want these companies worrying about that. Companies that are building products that are aimed at kids — and let’s be real — a lot of these companies have made explicit attempts to recruit teens and even preteens onto their services. Absolutely, yep. They have been treating those teens historically as just a gold mine of engagement, of money to be made, of habits to be formed. It’s been almost a predatory system. That is not how I want companies to approach their teenage users, as just a source of growth, a source of engagement, and a potential future customer base. I want them to be a little scared when they design a platform that they know is going to be inviting to teens. And I want them to be more careful than they would be if they were just doing normal engagement hacking, growth hacking, for their adult users. So I totally agree with that. I just also believe that 16-year-olds have speech rights. And I believe they have the right to consume a really wide array of content. And I don’t always think that they should have to provide an ID because they want to read or watch something. And that is the tension between those two things, is it’s very hard to square that circle. Yeah. Well, in conclusion, put us in control of Congress. We will write better bills than this. In conclusion, it’s easier to build LK-99 at home than it is to write a good internet regulation. [LAUGHS]: So true. So true. [MUSIC PLAYING] When we come back, we’re bringing back the hat. It’s time for HatGPT. Casey, it is time again to play HatGPT. Oh, finally. I’ve been waiting for this. [MUSIC PLAYING] As a reminder, this is our segment where we put a bunch of tech news stories into a hat, mix them up, pick them out one by one, and generate some plausible sounding language about them. And as a reminder to you, if one of us gets bored by the other person’s talking, we can just say stop generating. Beautiful. All right. I have an actual hat today. I did remember to bring one. And we have our little slips of paper here with our stories. Here, I’ll show you, Kevin. All right, so if you do this, then reach in, and then let’s see. First story, the BBC launches an experimental Mastodon server. So this is from The Verge, which lets us know that the BBC has launched its own experimental Mastodon server, marking one of the first major news outlets to establish an instance on the Twitter alternative. So Kevin, are you optimistic about the prospects of the BBC Mastodon server? No. And no offense to the BBC. Love the BBC. Mastodon has zero juice. I’m sorry. I know you are a Mastodon head. You’re a tooter, whatever the hell you guys are calling yourselves over there. I spent one day trying out Mastodon. I was like, this thing has zero juice. I think Mastodon, I appreciate that they have blazed a path for decentralized social media. It really did, yep. I appreciate that they came out with some ludicrous terms for what it is called to post on their platform, which is I believe toot. It’s a toot. It’s a toot. But Mastodon has zero juice, never has, and in my opinion, never will. I think right now, every media company in the world is trying to figure out what replaces Twitter. What replaces the role that Twitter used to have in our newsroom, as a place where we could distribute our stories, as a place where our journalists could talk about their stories and build their own audiences and direct people back to our website? I do not think Mastodon is that place. I don’t think Threads or Bluesky are either. And I just think media companies are going to be spending the next couple of years trying to figure out what comes after Twitter, and the answer may be nothing. OK, well, you could not be more wrong about any of this. And here’s why. So Mastodon uses the ActivityPub standards, and ActivityPub, within a couple of years, is going to be powering a huge part of digital media. So Tumblr, WordPress already are working on integrations with this. So in the future, media organizations are going to be able to have their own owned and operated little piece of the web. And it all starts with building your own little slice of the social media sphere. So is Mastodon full of very tedious and pedantic people? Yes, it is. Is it fun to use? No, but is the idea of a digital media organization trying to build its own part of the social web a good idea? Yes, it’s a good idea. It’s a theoretical yes and an actual no — Well — — is what you’re saying. We’re going to have to see how this all shakes out. But I can tell you, the BBC is not the only media organization that is thinking about how can we use ActivityPub to take advantage of all the best parts of the social web, which are essentially promoting your stuff to a big audience in real-time while getting rid of the walled garden nonsense that has infuriated so many people for so long. I just love imagining the BBC journalist who has spent their career like climbing the rungs of the UK’s media world. And you finally make it to the “beeb,” as they call it, and prestigious and respected outlet. And then the first day of your job, you get told that you have to toot. And it’s just like, well, why did I climb that ladder? If tooting is at the top of the ladder, that’s not a ladder I want to be on anymore. Yeah, I’m going back to one of those Rupert Murdaugh newspapers where you just spy on celebrities. All right, pass the hat! Mr. Beast sues his food delivery partner over inedible burgers. Oh, my God, I love this story. This story was so good. So OK, James Donaldson, a YouTube star better known as Mr. Beast, who we’ve talked about on the “Hard Fork” podcast very recently, has sued his partner in a food delivery business, saying the company sacrificed quality in its bid for rapid expansion. So this is a lawsuit that was recently filed by Jimmy Donaldson, a.k.a. Mr. Beast — James to the court. — against something called virtual dining concepts, which is one of these ghost kitchen businesses. What they do is they essentially — like if you run, let’s say, a Chinese restaurant, but you’re looking for a little extra revenue, and you have all the equipment that you would need to make burgers and sort of open up a virtual storefront, you could go to this Mr. Beast Burgers virtual restaurant and say, hey, I would like to start selling Mr. Beast Burgers on DoorDash and Uber Eats. And they would send you all the ingredients and the packaging. And you, as the owner of the Chinese restaurant, could essentially open up a stealth, secret storefront to sell Mr. Beast Burgers to your customers. And now if you were going to ask me what is the worst way to make a hamburger, I think that’s actually what I would tell you. And there have been some amazing just online roasts of these Mr. Beast Burgers. And some of them were actually in the complaint, which is one of the funniest legal complaints I’ve ever read, because it’s just like the headlines on the complaint are all like, “revolting,” “worst burger I’ve ever eaten.” So there have been these sort of attempts to track down where these Mr. Beast Burgers are actually being made because to be clear, these Mr. Beast Burgers are not being made at restaurants that Mr. Beast owns or has any real connection to. No, Mr. Beast has absolutely no idea what is going on with this empire of restaurants that he built under his own name. Right, and so that would be fine if these burgers were actually good, but it turns out that a lot of them are actually quite horrible. There’s very little quality control at these restaurants. And some of them are actually — one was someone who actually googled the address that his Mr. Beast Burger came from, and it was a 7-eleven. So 7-eleven is making Mr. Beast Burgers in some places. They’re making them on that’s the same rotisserie where they just have that hot dog that’s been spiraling for 16 years. Right, so Mr. Beast is now trying to get out of this contract with virtual dining concepts so that he no longer has to slap his name and likeness on these terrible burgers. Let me say something. We have a lot of celebrities and influencers that listen to this podcast, Kevin. And one thing that happens when you get famous is that people come to you with these moneymaking schemes. And they say, you’re going to about to make the easiest money you’ve ever made in your entire life. All you have to do is sign away your name and likeness, and the money will start rolling in. And I hope all of you fellow influencers and creators and celebrities out there take the lesson of the Beast Burger, which is, you have to have the quality control standards in place, or otherwise, people are going to have diarrhea. [LAUGHING]: Wise words. And I will say that if you are interested in opening up a “Hard Fork” burger, I mean, the fork is right there in the name. We’re interested in partnerships and sponsorship opportunities. Please get in touch, but also have a certificate from the Health Department, please, and know how to make food. Stop generating. OK. Now it’s my turn. OK, Meta prepares chat bots with personas to try to retain users — this is from the Financial Times. Facebook owner Meta is preparing to launch a range of artificial intelligence powered chat bots that exhibit different personalities as soon as next month in an attempt to boost engagement with its social media platforms. These people said some of the chat bots, which staffers have dubbed personas, take the form of different characters. The company has explored launching one that emulates Abraham Lincoln and another that advises on travel options in the style of a surfer. So I guess my question, Kevin, is, who are you more excited to talk about on Facebook — Abraham Lincoln or someone who advises on travel options in the style of a surfer? I wish that I could combine them and get travel advice from Abraham Lincoln. Yeah. It’s like, well, I’m going to tell you one theater in the Washington area to avoid. Do not go to the Ford Theater. Avoid. Zero stars. [LAUGHING] Is it too soon? It’s too soon. It’s too soon. Oh, God. It’s too soon. So I read about this story in a little newsletter called Platformer this week. Yeah, it’s a good one. You had a good post about this. And it is really interesting to me that Meta is sort of plowing ahead with this plan that, from what I can tell, zero actual people have expressed an interest in this. Like, I understand that they are trying to jam generative AI into as many of their products as they can. They’re also doing this open source strategy with their language model, LLaMA, which is very interesting, and we’ve talked about. But I do not get this personas thing at all. So can you just explain to me what they think the appeal of this is going to be and why they think this is going to boost engagement on their product? Yeah, so the big theory here is that you are going to interact with many different kinds of generative AI personas in the future. So you might have an AI Spanish tutor. You might have an AI fitness coach. You may have an AI therapist. And Meta wants to get to work building some of those now. But those things aren’t really ready for prime time. And so what we have instead are these chat bots that can mimic Abraham Lincoln or a surfer with travel tips. And so that’s what they’re rolling out. There is some evidence that people want things like this. So you know the company, Character AI. This is essentially what they do. You can go to character.ai right now, log in with your account, and you can start chatting with any number of fictional or non-fictional people. And there is a pretty vibrant community on Reddit of people sharing their conversations that they’re having there. So it’s clear to me that there is some kind of appetite for this, but I don’t know. When I’ve used the character AI bots, it just feels like a total passing fad to me. There is not a lot of long-term benefit to me there. I was writing in the newsletter this week, like, what is the long-term value of an Abraham Lincoln? But I get it if you’re writing a school report or something, and you want to ask him, like, hey, who killed you or whatever? But beyond that, I don’t really get it. I would like an Abraham Lincoln bot that could give me the weather, but using Abraham — like, it’s going four score and two degrees out today. You might want to put on sunblock. So, look, I think Meta has a lot of technology and not a lot of idea about what to do with it at the moment. I think one reason why they’re giving all this stuff away is that it’s not clear to them what exactly are you going to put in it right now. Right, they don’t make office productivity software that can be augmented with AI to make workers more productive or save businesses a lot of money. They make social media products. I guess my curiosity around this is for many years, social media companies have been trying to get bots off their services, right? It’s not good for them if some percentage of their engagement is coming from these artificial sources. So why is this different than that? Well, because those bots are created by others. They’re like, we want to own the bots. Yeah, exactly. Meta wants to own the bot. I mean, what Meta wants is eyeballs to be on Meta products, and if bots bring eyeballs to Meta products, then it will build them. OK, next one. Stop generating. Greg Rutkowski was removed from Stable Diffusion, but AI artists brought him back. This is from Decrypt. So there’s this digital artist that we are both familiar with his work, Kevin, Greg Rutkowski. Yeah, we’ve talked about him on the show before. Yeah, he is one of the most popular artists in the AI world because he makes these sort of sweeping fantastical creations. And so when people are using these text to image models, they love to invoke his name because they will get such cool images back. Right. This was sort of like a hack or a cheat code, almost, that people figured out when these sort of mid-journey Stable Diffusion Dall-E image generators were in their infancy, is like, if you wanted to create a very cool image of a dragon, all you had to do was like insert Greg Rutkowski’s name into the prompt, because he was the best person out there at making these fantasy drawings, and so it would just make it look like one of his things, which is great if you’re trying to make cool art. It’s not so great if you’re Greg Rutkowski. Yeah, and so, Greg, which I’ll just call him Greg for ease of pronunciation, doesn’t want anything to do with any of this. And so he says, hey, take me out of your image generator. And so Stable Diffusion, one of the companies that makes these text to image generators, responds by removing his work from their data set. But the community has now created a tool to mimic Rutkowski’s style against his wishes. And since Stable Diffusion is open source, there’s nothing he or Stability AI can do about it, says Decrypt. So Kevin, what do we make of the fact that even when you’re an artist, and you say, I don’t want to be part of this, and the company that makes the AI image generator takes you out of it, eh, it doesn’t matter. You’re still going to be in it. It sucks, man. I mean, I’m thinking about this from Greg Rutkowski’s perspective. He was just a normal, working artist, doing his job, making great art that people loved, had a good, solid career as an artist, which is like a hard thing to pull off in any era, but especially this one. And now, his reward for that is that when these new AI image generators get invented, he sort of becomes this ghost in the machine that people are just of using to conjure up these things that look exactly like the stuff that he drew on his own. And on one hand, a lot more people know about Greg Rutkowski now than did a few years ago. We’re talking about him. So it clearly hasn’t been all bad for his career. But I do sympathize with his frustration, which is like, I don’t want to be the test case guinea pig for all these AI image generators. And I worry about his ability to make a living when, now, anyone can just put his name into an image generator and pull up something that looks vaguely like he might have done it. So I do think that concern is real. At the same time, I think this sort of exposes the futility of these artists and content creators trying to get removed from the training sets of these things. Yeah, I agree with that. I would also say we’re early enough in this journey that it would be great if companies could build tools that effectively do remove artists or creators or journalists who do not want their work to be part of the training set. I do think that people should have the right to remove themselves from the training data. All that said, my curiosity is, if we talk to Greg Rutkowski five years from now, is he making more money than he did before he became one of the big stars of AI text image generation? I bet he will be, but I bet he will still be pissed off that all this is happening. Wow, that sounds like you know him personally. Yeah, Greg, call a guy. All right, stop generating. OK, next one. Twitter removes X on headquarters. This is from “The New York Times.” Workers on Monday dismantled a giant X sign that was only briefly displayed on the roof of Twitter’s headquarters in San Francisco after residents complained, and the city issued a violation notice for lacking proper permits, according to local officials. The sign was installed on Friday to reflect the company’s new branding and spurred immediate concern. Over the weekend, the city received 24 complaints, which included concerns about its structural safety and flashing lights. One complaint described extremely intense white stroboscopic light that was causing distress and nausea. Casey, what do you make of the giant X being taken down from Twitter’s roof? I mean, I love this story because it goes to show you what the actual most powerful force in all of San Francisco is, which is NIMBYs. If you want to build something in this town, and you don’t have the proper permitting, you are about to experience the full force of the state, OK? You’re going to have more people beating a path down your door than you thought was possible. And so Elon Musk, who has been able to wield his authority over so many people and get everything that he wanted, ever since he marched into Twitter headquarters with that sink, finally found the one force that he could not overcome. And it was the San Francisco NIMBYs. Yes, Elon Musk is the most powerful man in the world, except when it comes to building things in San Francisco, at which point his powers cease to become meaningful. But if I could say one more serious thing, it’s that last week, I talked about my theory that Elon Musk is a cultural vandal. And to me, this is more cultural vandalism. It’s like, I’m literally just going to put a giant, flashing, disgusting X on the top of this historic building as a kind of symbolic middle finger to the entire city. Ha-ha. LOL. Like, it is just so in keeping with his character. Did you actually see it during the brief period when it was actually up? No, and here’s why. This thing was so tall, and it was held down by sandbags. Or at least, they appeared to be sandbags from the overhead photography. And I thought, I’m willing to sacrifice a lot to cover the story of Elon Musk, but I am not going to die when a stiff wind blows that thing off Market Street and onto my head. [LAUGHS]: It did look not that stable. It was also like, it was a choice to make it flash stroboscopic lights. It was a choice to not have it just be a lit up X, but to have it be the most annoying version of an X possible. Yeah, the only thing it didn’t do was like sound an air horn every time the lights flashed, but they probably just didn’t have the time to install that yet. [LAUGHS]: Don’t give him any ideas. Stop generating. All right, your turn. Last one. A-ha. Uber turns its first ever operating profit. This is from The Wall Street Journal. The results for the three months through June were driven by solid growth in both of Uber’s core businesses, as the number of rides in the US and Canada surpassed pre-pandemic levels for the first time and demand for delivery stayed strong, despite restaurant reopenings. This was the first quarter that Uber was profitable since it was founded in 2009. So, Kevin, in the very early days of this show, we did a segment where we wondered whether Uber would ever turn a profit. And I don’t know at the time that either of us thought that it would have been like in 2023. Yeah, I mean, this is sort of a fascinating story to me because for so long, we have heard so much about these venture funded startups that just sold products or services at a loss, essentially used their venture funding to subsidize prices to flood the market and drown out competition, and did that very successfully, but also lost billions and billions of dollars in the process. And for many years, Uber was one of those companies. And there was a huge question about whether it actually would ever be able to turn a profit. And now it has and may keep turning profits into the future. So do you think this is sort of like a vindication of this strategy that all these companies had, of like getting your prices as low as possible by pouring venture capital money into the market and then sort of jacking up your prices later so that you can actually turn a profit? Basically, I do, because even when it was at its most unprofitable, no part of me ever thought that Uber or something like it was going to go away because it is just unimaginable to me now that you won’t be able to be in a relatively big city and tap a button on your phone, and a car appears. People desperately want that. And as we’ve learned over the past year, they will pay higher prices in order to get that service maybe than they were used to paying when there was all that venture capital money in it. So I think it’s a pretty big achievement for the Uber folks that they were able to get there. We’ll see if they can keep it up. I would say that surprising to me, a large part of their business is Uber Eats. And I think to the extent that there are actual profits there, it is much more about being a delivery business than a rideshare business. But one t",

      "text": "7 August 2023 Kelly Clarkson has changed the lyrics to ‘Piece by Piece’ to reflect her split from Brandon Blackstock. Kelly Clarkson has changed her song lyrics The 41-year-old pop star recently performed the amended version of the track during her Las Vegas residency, and Kelly explained the meaning behind the change to the audience. The singer – who was married to Brandon between 2013 and 2021 – said: “This song I initially wrote just super hopeful, right? And well, sometimes hopeful turns into hopeless, so here we go, ‘Piece by Piece’.” The song is a sequel to Kelly’s 2004 hit single ‘Because of You’, which focuses on the pain that absent parenting caused her. On the original version of ‘Piece by Piece’, Kelly sang: “He never walks away / He never asks for money / He takes care of me / He loves me.” But on the amended version of the track, she sang: “I just walk away / when they ask for money / I take care of me / ’cause I love me.” Meanwhile, Kelly previously revealed that her kids continue to “dream” that she’ll reunite with her ex-husband. The singer – who has Remy, seven, and River, eight, with Brandon – revealed that her children continue to hope for a reconciliation. Kelly told the ‘We Can Do Hard Things’ podcast: “Your kids will still have a hard time. It doesn’t matter if you stay, it doesn’t matter if you go, I am still having conversations [with my kids] three years later. “My kids just came back from my ex and any time there’s mention of maybe him being with somebody else … they are just really adamant about keeping that dream alive that we might still be together one day.”",

      "title": "The CFR Taiwan task force report: Advice and dissent",
      "text": "Kaiser Kuo: Welcome to the Sinica Podcast, a weekly discussion of current affairs in China, produced in partnership with The China Project. Subscribe to Access from The China Project to get, well, access. Access to not only our great newsletter, the Daily Dispatch, but to all of the original writing on our website at thechinaproject.com. We’ve got reported stories, essays and editorials, great explainers, regular columns, and, of course, a growing library of podcasts. We cover everything from China’s fraught foreign relations to its ingenious entrepreneurs, from the ongoing repression of Uyghurs and other Muslim peoples in China’s Xinjiang region to Beijing’s ambitious plans to shift the Chinese economy onto a post-carbon footing. It’s a feast of business, political, and cultural news about a nation that is reshaping the world. We cover China with neither fear nor favor. I’m Kaiser Kuo, coming to you from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. _____________ Last month in June, the Council on Foreign Relations, CFR, published a report called U.S.-Taiwan Relations in a New Era: Responding to a More Assertive China. The task force was chaired by Susan M. Gordon and Michael G. Mullen, and David Sacks was the project director. It brought together 26 participants, many of whom will be known to listeners of this podcast. As the task force was bipartisan, it included people’s views on Taiwan, on China, and on many other issues, which were quite far apart, shall we say. And so it is not at all surprising that there were a number of dissenting views on both the more hawkish and dovish sides, as it were. This week on Sinica, I’ve asked two of the task force participants, both of whom I’ve had on the show, talking about Taiwan in recent years before, and both of whom penned dissents to the CFR report that were published along with that report. Maggie Lewis is a professor of law at Seton Hall and has been on the program before to talk, not just about the Taiwan elections of January 2020 when she was there, along with Shelley Rigger and a lot of the sort of smartest folks on Taiwan out there for that election. She was also on the show the following year to talk about the DOJ’s China Initiative, no longer so named, but still doing its thing. Maggie has been at the forefront on that issue, doing the important work of pushing back against the ethnic profiling that has bedeviled that controversial program since its inception back in the Trump administration. Maggie joins us from Taipei. Welcome back to Sinica. Great to see you. Margaret Lewis: Always a pleasure to be here. And, boy, is this presidential race getting interesting in Taiwan. Kaiser: Well, you’ve already promised me that we’re going to get you for a before and after of that, so you’ll be hearing a lot from Maggie come election time. All right, our other guest today, joining us from the City of the Big Shoulders, Chicago, Illinois, is Paul Heer, who listeners will know from his turns on the show. Paul was trained as a historian and has had a long career at the CIA, where he headed the China Desk for many years, and from 2007 to 2015 was the National Intelligence Officer for East Asia, in the office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI. He is the author of Mr. X and the Pacific: George F. Kennan and American Policy in East Asia, and bears, I have to say, an uncanny physical resemblance to the subject of that book. Paul is now at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Welcome back to Sinica. Great to see you. Paul Heer: Thank you very much. I’m delighted to be invited. Kaiser: Just looking at the names of the participants, I think anyone with even a glancing familiarity with the China policy field would know that there was certainly going to be a lot of disagreement within this group. What were the ground rules going in? How was this obvious issue intended to be resolved? They certainly didn’t think you would all come to a set of common denominators of points of agreement, and that that would be a wrap. Maggie? Maggie: As you said, this was a robust discussion over a long period of time. I appreciate that CFR brought together a range of views, and I think that shows just how much conversation and real debate there is about the best path forward for U.S. policy toward Taiwan. And two, just to be clear, CFR member-based organization, that CFR itself does not take a position. This is an independent expert group that is putting together this report. I really found it useful. I agree that when I’m in a room with Matt Pottinger, we’re going to have differences, but I’d much rather be in a room with people who are going to disagree with me in ways that push me to think about my views and to articulate them better. I also appreciated that there was the space to have additional views/dissents, because ultimately, this is a report that has got a strong military energy, and that is, of course, key. But there’s a lot more to this debate than just the military aspects. Kaiser: Yeah, for sure. That’s something that I wanted to drill down on and talk to you about. I do want to get a little more of the mechanics of how this thing worked. Maybe Maggie you could elaborate a little bit and talk about the actual process of producing the report. There were days of in-person meetings and then maybe drafts sent around? Maggie: David Sacks is the project director, and he did the real heavy lifting. And behind him too, there’s the CFR staff that works not just on this task force, but more generally on the task force, who really were fantastic at hurting us cats, because it’s not easy to have as many people involved. It was a mix of in-person for some people, and then others of us were remote in Zoom land, but it was a series of meetings that were punctuated then in between with sharing drafts, and before it was a full draft, sort of in progress points. Certainly, some things were kind of easier to do, the history, which is not without its complications, but that part took less of our effort. And then issues like what to do about strategic ambiguity, of course, is going to take a lot more energy to figure out, were we going to get to any sort of general coalescing on a point that could be put into the report itself, or do we have to agree to disagree? But it was over the course of a number of months, and then to the point then you finally get to people like me who are lawyers who like digging in to figure out where there’s commas that shouldn’t be. It was definitely an iterative process involving a lot of brains. Kaiser: Paul, what were some areas where you had, I mean, Maggie mentioned history, but where you had perfect or near-perfect consensus? Were there some assumptions going into this that you could safely assert were shared by all of the participants or at least the overwhelming majority of the participants? Paul: If you look at the key findings and recommendations, well, actually more importantly, the key findings, I think there was a consensus from the outset that the reason to confront this issue was that the formulation, the diplomatic formulation that had been made, maintained stability across the Taiwan Strait for the last 40 years was faltering and was no longer serving its purposes over the longer term. There was a common understanding and agreement that that challenge needed to be confronted. You asked about whether there was an expectation or a requirement that we’d reach an agreement and what the ground rules were. As Maggie said, it was an iterative process, but there was no requirement that we come to closure on the issues. The way that the task force, CFR task force is arranged is there’ll be this iterative deliberative process where we’ll go through successive drafts and successive meetings to wade through things. But then, at the end of the process, the final draft will be presented. And the way it was framed was that we have the option of concurring on the report or withdrawing from it if we fundamentally disagree with its thrust. I think those of us who wanted to sign additional or dissenting views did so because we largely agreed with the central thrust of the imperative confronting the issue. I think there was much less disagreement on some of the general security issues, some of the economic issues, for example. I mean, Maggie can speak for herself. I saw the greatest divergences of views on some of the diplomatic and political issues. Kaiser: Sure, sure, sure. Paul: But as I said, we were given the opportunity to record those, so there was no requirement that we reach full agreement on everything. Kaiser: Right. Are you at liberty to say whether there were any withdrawals? Paul: Not to my knowledge, actually. Not that I recall. Kaiser: Okay. Interesting. There were some things that were in the body of the report that certainly resonated with me. One line that stuck out was “Beijing has not yet decided to pursue a non-peaceful resolution, and deterrence remains possible.” That hopeful note which is quite key in there, but much of the report does ring alarms, and it talks about, I mean, from the very, very outset in Richard Haass’s introduction to it, he talks about this 2027 date, and it’s referred to many times throughout the report, this date that’s often attributed to Admiral Philip Davidson. Whether the readiness that Xi Jinping has supposedly set out is a goal for the PLA centennial actually means, not just be ready for it, but actually go for it, going to do the thing. For our purposes today, how seriously did the CFR task force take this 2027 date? And was there debate over the significance of it or whether it should be included in the report without the context e.g., that, well, it’s the centennial of the PLA and has more symbolic than maybe real import? Paul: On that issue, I think that the task force kind of quickly converged around what had, by that time, become the general consensus. There’s been a lot of drawing on this issue for the last two years. But the general view, and I think there was general agreement within the task force on this, is that the 2027 date is a timeframe for the acquisition of a capability. It does not reflect a decision to send a balloon up when that date arrives. Well, I’m not reading classified information anymore on a regular basis, but I don’t think there’s any discernible evidence for that. I think that the general public discourse on that issue has reached that, kind of tendered a conclusion. That was not strongly debated within the task force, but I think that we generally agreed on that point. Kaiser: Maggie, as you mentioned, much of the report focuses on the military calculus around Beijing’s capabilities, stuff about which I will readily cop to abject ignorance, but Maggie, you worry, as I do, that seeding the ground of expertise on military matters kind of allows those people who do have knowledge to have maybe disproportionate way or to give disproportionate way to the military component of the relationship at the expense of diplomatic and political and economic considerations. It’s one of the things that you expressed discomfort with in your dissent, this dominant military thrust of the report as you described it. This echoes what I’ve often heard from people like Ryan Hass, his co-authors on this new book U.S. Taiwan Relations, Bonnie Glaser, and Richard Bush. Ryan, as well as Paul, and others as well have often described the Taiwan issue as a political issue with a military dimension, right? But Maggie, your concern seems to be that it’s presented in this report as too military forward. Maggie: I think there’s a couple things going on here. First, we need to have a credible military deterrent, but we also need credible reassurance. One of the recommendations of the task force is that the United States maintain its One China Policy, recognizing the PRC is the sole legal government of China. Saying that, we go into the history and make clear that the U.S. has not taken a position on the sovereignty of Taiwan. And thank goodness many years ago that the U.S. government only acknowledged the PRC’s position of the One-China principle that it has Taiwan as part of China. The U.S. never recognized, endorsed, or anything like that. So, we do have in this report that political aspect. But my view was that that didn’t get enough attention in the report, particularly with respect to what extent there should be assurances that the One China Policy on the U.S. has not shifted, and in particular with Biden’s multiple remarks that seem to be setting a new baseline and even making some connections to treatment of Taiwan as similar to treaty allies like Japan. It’s there, but it needed some oomph in my view. The other aspect is that, I, as someone who spent a lot of time in Taiwan, lived here three of the past six years, and perhaps because of my human rights framing, just wanted to make sure too that there was enough Taiwan in this report. It is D.C.-centric with good reason because we’re people writing for a U.S. audience. This was not written by people who identify as Taiwanese or ROC passport holders. But I think it is important to recognize, as we do, that the people who would be most devastated by any military conflict are the people who live here in Taiwan. And also making clear that Taiwan needs to do more to address its shortfalls with respect to defense and civil resilience. That was something which I think is in there, but I certainly want to make sure it gets enough attention as well. Kaiser: On that point, on the lack of sort of Taiwan centricity to this, was there, to your knowledge, any effort to rope in more people with specific Taiwan expertise into this? Because again and again in these things, Taiwan ends up being this sort of bone of contention, and it ends up being entirely framed as this sort of great power, U.S. and China thing, and Taiwan falls out of the conversation. We all recognize this as a problem, I hope, but it keeps on happening. You are obviously somebody who qualifies, but I didn’t see a lot of other names who immediately jumped out at me as people who are really invested in intellectually and maybe act professionally in Taiwan itself. Maggie: I do not know the process that they went through to put together the task force. And I’ll be first to say that, although I’ve spent a lot of time in Taiwan, I do not identify as Taiwanese. I’m a U.S. passport holder, and I never want to make it sound like I’ve got this, right? Again, it was supposed to be about U.S. policy toward Taiwan. But I think, though, at the same time, just sort of recognizing our limits about what we could do and not do in this report. But I will say, though, I felt very listened to, and I appreciate that. We had some people in the task force who had tremendous knowledge of geopolitics, international relations, U.S. politics, but quite limited Taiwan experience, and I appreciated that they were very interested in hearing from those of us who had spent more time on the ground here. Paul: Yeah. On the Taiwan perspective, I would make two points. One, Doug Paal was a member of the task force. As a former AIT director, he has a depth and breadth of expertise on the Taiwan issue. The second thing, which is mentioned, and I think in the foreword to the report is that a subset of the membership of the task force, David Sacks and Sue Gordon, and I think Admiral Harris went to Taiwan on a fact-finding trip early this year, directly as a product of this task force to conduct a wide range of meetings inside and outside the government there. So that was another contribution to the Taiwan perspective. Kaiser: Okay. This is a little out of order from what I originally planned, but let’s move to this question that Maggie’s already introduced about the fate of strategic ambiguity because the report is ostensibly ambiguous on this question of strategic ambiguity, maybe strategically so. It claims to have not reached agreement on that question, but it seems to me that the report itself, taken without the dissents that were published with it, does lean very much toward what Richard Haass endorses, sort of an end to strategic ambiguity. I think this may be the most controversial section, this box that’s titled “with a Strategic Ambiguity,” and it says the following, let me just quote this, and Maggie has brought this up already, “The task force also assessed that given President Biden’s comments on four occasions that the United States would defend Taiwan, his successors should not attempt to walk back these comments and should instead use them as the new baseline for U.S. declaratory policy.” That’s in there. That’s part of the report. That must have been a controversial assertion. Paul: Well, I think partly that was a late addition to the report, and it prompted some dissenting views because we were inconclusive in our discussion of that issue. I would note that David Sacks, who was the drafter, the director of the task force and the drafter of the report, was the co-author with Richard Haass of Richard’s article a couple years ago advocating strategic clarity. I mean, that was just a perspective he was going to come from, and then there were other members of the task force to believe that. I think there was an imprecision there on the inclusion of that statement as reflecting the views of the task force as Maggie and I, and I think perhaps one or two others, made explicit in our dissents. Kaiser: Yeah, Maggie, you certainly did. You called this out in your dissent. Is there any way in which this can be interpreted as less than the task force essentially calling for an end to the very essence of strategic ambiguity that is we will defend Taiwan if Taiwan is attacked, no conditions applied to it? Maggie: I think, as it says, the task force did not come out on that to that level. I agree with Paul that this was something which obviously several of us made our years go up, and was part, not the only reason that we decided, several of us, to add our additional views/descent. But one thing that I point out too is that before that sentence that you quoted, we also say that the task force concluded that the, you know, more pressing issue is for the United States to credibly demonstrate to the PRC that it has the military capacity and the will to come to Taiwan’s defense. And I think that there was a consensus that we need to show that we’re serious, right? But again, this comes back to the alongside showing that military might, that where is the political side? Where is the credible reassurance on what the policy is, and how clear is that, how loud is it? And there is debate about sort of, well, yeah, saying that isn’t going to matter. Why does the U.S. have to keep saying what the One China Policy is to the Chinese side? I think that there is good reason to say where we are as a country in our policy, especially because Biden has been not as disciplined as certainly I would’ve hoped in his comments on the issue. Paul: I think there was an effort to finesse the language, which frankly was not entirely successful. The final reference, to using President Biden’s statements, as a new baseline for established U.S. policy. In one sense, that’s kind of technically correct because he’s said it now four times. It’s the point of departure for a lot of analysis. But I mean, the language does stop short or at least attempts to translating that into advocacy of strategic clarity, which we did not collectively agree to do. Kaiser: Paul, let me ask you this, as I read the report, deterrence is very much the theme of it, and it’s very much front and center throughout the report. But I didn’t sense that much consideration was given to Chinese calculations of deterrence. After all, what they are trying to do is to deter Taiwan from declaring de jure independence, and deter the United States from intervening militarily. I mean, they flicked at it, but it seems to be sort of an afterthought. It wasn’t really centered in the thinking of how Beijing sees this. Is there enough attention being paid to how, maybe if we could imagine a Beijing counterpart to this task force, a group, a small leading group or some group, foreign policy think tank, how are they thinking about deterrence? And are we thinking about how they’re thinking about deterrence? Paul: That’s an excellent question. I think you’re right that that is not direct or addressed at great length in the report. And it wasn’t really a central part of the deliberations or a key part of the deliberation of the task force. Actually, you’re highlighting one of the concerns I had, and Maggie mentioned earlier, this overemphasis, as we saw it, on deterrence, on the need for U.S. deterrence. There’s no disagreement that our military deterrent could benefit from being enhanced. I think we also agree with the recommendations that the report makes about the efforts we need to do to encourage the Taiwanese side of the equation to enhance its deterrence. But we didn’t focus that much on how the Chinese perceived it. My concern was that in the political sections of the report, and even earlier than that, rather than address the Chinese calculus of deterrence, there was an overemphasis on the assumption that what is happening in terms of the escalation of tensions is not a product of Chinese calculus of deterrence. There was an inordinate weight that’s assigned to it that the source of tensions across the strait is essentially the Chinese determination that the status quo is no longer acceptable and that China has become more aggressive and more assertive for systemic reasons, for CCP legitimacy reasons, and for Xi Jinping personal interest and legacy reasons. This is one of the things I’ve registered in my descent because I thought that the Chinese perspective was, in a sense, exaggerated and overstated. Because you asked the question about how the Chinese calculates deterrence, I think that is a key question because what I think, or the report gives insufficient attention to, is the extent to which Chinese calculations, Chinese behavior, in fact, across the strait, is a response to, or reaction to activities or policies or statements from both Taipei and Washington. Kaiser: Precisely. Paul: And there’s acknowledgement in the report of this, but I think it isn’t discussed in sufficient detail. Kaiser: No, I think you’re absolutely right. Maybe to the task force’s credit, it does recognize, to some extent, that maybe overemphasizing deterrence could actually provoke the conflict that that deterrence is intended to avoid. But this is just sort of said and allowed to sit there without really delving into how that would work, how that might play out, or whether it is in fact already causing Chinese behavior to change, right? Maggie: There is a recognition of the action-reaction dynamic that we are concerned about where that ratcheting up. And so with this, too, it’s interesting because one thing about being in Taiwan right now is we’re seeing a lot of people come through Taiwan, and starting to see too many people being able to go to China itself. You had Neysun Mahboubi on recently to talk about his trip to China. One thing that struck me throughout this report is just the Rumsfeldian “known unknowns.” What do we know? And how the lack of contact amongst academics, think tankers, as well as government people, means that we just have less information to go on. I was in Tokyo before coming to Taipei and had a chance to meet with some international relations scholars from China. And to be back in a room talking with them and having the tea breaks, it was just invaluable. So, part of my feeling throughout this process was a sense of that loss of contact, and really just trying to not read too much into the published speeches that we do have and taking a few key sentences in Taiwan and extrapolating, well, then this must be Xi Jinping’s thinking. Kaiser: That’s right. Let me go back, Paul, to you. Your dissenting opinion focuses on what I think is a very central issue, not just in this report, but in general, on how the American media and policy elites seem on balance to view the causes of this state of affairs. I am constantly seeing this assertion that, like you said, this is China, primarily, that this is for the various reasons that you cited, whether it’s Xi’s personality or for sort of structural changes or what have you, that China has been the principal agent of change to the so-called status quo when it comes to Taiwan. I think the report very much reflects that same general belief. I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say that it assigns the preponderance of blame to China. In your descent, which I have to say is quite brave in this current environment, you try to exercise that strategic empathy and look critically at how our behavior, this is a theme we’ve been trying to draw out here, might at least be perceived by China, even legitimately perceived by China as threatening the status quo. So, I’m going to ask you to do this. I know this is risking your neck and your career, everything, but you’re retired, so it’s okay, where have we sliced the salami? What has the United States done to move the status quo? And then maybe we can also talk about what Taiwan has done to move the status quo. I think we should, just in fairness, also talk about how China has to move the status quo, but this is already the conventional wisdom, and everyone is already full of ideas of how China has done so. I think it’s more important to highlight the first two. First, the United States, Paul. Paul: Well, that’s a loaded question. Kaiser: Not leading, though. Paul: My first thought was, you started in terms of the attribution of responsibility for the Cross-Strait tensions being primarily Beijing. I would just reinforce maybe the point I made earlier, and I think Maggie referred to this, it goes beyond that to a certain extent and attributes it in particular to Xi Jinping. There’s a statement in the report that you mentioned earlier, that the risk of conflict will increase over time for various reasons, but one of the central drivers that this is attributed to is this judgment that Xi Jinping, as his tenure proceeds, his source of legitimacy will shift from economic prosperity to promoting nationalism. In fact, Patty Kim, in her descent, questions this judgment for the same reason that I do, and I think Maggie does as well. Again, it’s the idea that Beijing is responsible, and Xi Jinping in particular. To get to the core of your question, I think that’s a misattribution of one of the core drivers here. What I say in my dissent is that we have to pay attention to the extent to which Xi, whatever his calculations or his personal ambitions, is to some extent responding to actions by Taipei and Washington. This is where I emphasize the point, and this gets to your question about salami slicing that we recommend in the report that Washington needs to reaffirm its One China Policy. My concern is that this does not give sufficient attention to the extent to which that One China Policy has been eroding considerably in terms of both substance and credibility. And you asked, what do I mean by that in terms of the specific salami slicing measures? The strengthening of U.S.-Taiwan relations incrementally over the last 20 years. The report explicitly acknowledges that these are sources of tension. The fact that the Trump administration largely eliminated any constraints on diplomatic interaction with Taiwan leaders that certainly in Washington, and the Biden administration has retained that loosening of tensions. I think the other is reflected in another part of the report. We’re slicing the salami and, in the sense, getting closer toward, arguably, and I don’t know if I say this explicitly in the descent, but it’s harder to make the case that our policy is not drifting toward a One China, One Taiwan policy. We did have discussion of this in the task force. The report cites, in the security section, and this I think is a central part of the salami slicing. Again, to reinforce that, I’m addressing your question, the testimony that Assistant Secretary of Defense Ely Ratner made in December ’21. Kaiser: That’s right. I was going to treat that as a separate issue entirely, but we can start into that now. Paul: I think it fits into this category of Chinese perceptions of U.S. salami slicing. And the report largely endorses the notion, in fact, almost explicitly that Taiwan is a strategic node, is a strategic asset. I think this is the heel of the salami from Beijing’s perspective because this is a new historical formulation that I think is arguably inconsistent with the affirmation that the report makes that we need to provide assurances to Beijing that we’re not pursuing permanent separation of Taiwan from the mainland. But to view and present and portray and advocate Taiwan as a critical strategic node that cannot be allowed to fall under Chinese hostile hands, by and large, arguably makes the case for advocating permanent separation. And that’s a large cut of salami. That’s why, my point, as I said in the descent, is that, I mean, that’s one of the reasons why we need to be much more persuasive in our affirmation that our One China Policy has not changed. Because when Beijing says that… well, I’m not going to advocate the Chinese rhetorical perspective on this, but I mean, it’s less persuasive to issue reassurances. In fact, the last point I’ll make, Maggie and I were, among others, who raised this same point, that the emphasis on deterrence in the report is not sufficiently balanced by the emphasis on reassurance. And this is where reassurances are vitally important. The report acknowledges the need to do this, but it doesn’t go into sufficient detail on what the form and substance and nature of those assurances need to be. I think they have to involve a more credible explanation of our One China Policy to make it consistent with what it historically has been. Kaiser: Maggie, are you in agreement with Paul, were you also alarmed at this kind of formulation of Taiwan as a strategic asset of a critical node that needs to be denied to China? Was that something that also stuck out for you? Maggie: Yes. Taking a step back, in the part of the report that describes what is the One China Policy, which, of course, itself is complicated because there is no single document headlined One China Policy, one of the bullet points that we make clear is that part of that policy is that the U.S. does not take a position on what any resolution of Cross-Strait differences should look like. Instead, prioritizing process, in particular, that any outcome needs to be arrived at peacefully and as added during the Clinton administration with the ascent of the Taiwanese people. For me, that’s critical. And partially, again, you let a human rights person onto a fairly military-focused task force. But this comes down to me, that’s respecting self-determination, right? It is not the U.S.’s job to tell the 23 million people surrounding me on Taiwan what their future should look like. But it is fair to say whatever process, the U.S. supports that it be done peacefully and in a democratic manner. For me, that is really, really important. And I say that, again, as the election season is heating up here, which could turn out with having a three-way race right now, and who knows what Terry Gou’s going to do, and maybe make it a four-way, and throw in James Soong, we could have a five-way race. But that is their choice, not my choice. And so, to throw in this, well, because Taiwan is strategically important, which is a descriptive matter, yeah, I mean, if Beijing could make it so they launch submarines from the east side of Taiwan, that changes what happens in the Indo-Pacific, and it changes our ability, as the United States, to feel confident in even how much we can help out, maybe perhaps even allies like Japan. I think it’s a descriptive matter. The U.S. has tremendous interests in Taiwan militarily, but as a policy matter, what really needs to be made loud and clear and highlighted in neon lights is this point about the U.S. does not, and nor do I think should it take a position on the ultimate status of Taiwan, what that endgame should be. Kaiser: This point was made really, really clearly in the Doug Paal and Danny Russel dissent. I think that was sort of the centerpiece of theirs. Maybe it’s important to ID them both quickly. Doug Paal, we’ve mentioned it before, was a foreign service officer who was at Policy Planning at State. He had a long career as a senior analyst for the CIA. He was at AIT, importantly; was an NSC staffer during Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Danny Russel, who I had the great pleasure of interviewing for this show, was a career foreign service officer who served as the assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific under President Obama. He’s now the VP of International Security and Diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Neither of these guys is a panda hugger. They’re not kumbaya types. They raise really important objections to this piece of the task force findings, and on those same grounds that Maggie, you were talking about. Because the U.S., it has to make clear that it is prepared to accept unification on terms that the U.S. has long agreed to. It would accept that as peacefully and with the ascent of both Taiwan and China. If we treat Taiwan as a strategic asset, that forecloses the possibility that we would accept even a peaceful unification. Is that correct? Paul: Yeah, I think that was the point that we were making. In fact, that would reinforce that. Ryan Hass at the Brookings Institution just published an article, which reinforces this point as well. The risks in Taiwan of treating it and talking about it as a strategic asset. Kaiser: Yeah, that was a great piece. It’s in the Taiwan Times, right? Is that right? Paul: Taipei Times, I think. Kaiser: Taipei Times. Paul: But you can find it there or on the Brookings website. Kaiser: Yeah. It’s a very good, very short op-ed, but it makes exactly that same point. So, Doug and Danny, Doug Paal and Danny Russel, argue that this simply contradicts the longstanding assertion that any future arrangement is up to the people of China and Taiwan to decide. Maggie: I want to add here, though, in some ways, just to make clear that the people of Taiwan have made very clear that it’s not in the realm of possibility in the near right, or I think median, at least turn, that there won’t be their ascent to join with the PRC under a single entity. Right. For this, we’ve already mentioned early on Shelley Rigger, but she’s done work with Lev Nachman, who is a political scientist based in Taiwan that goes beyond the standard polling that asks about identity, which itself is fascinating to see the rise in Taiwanese identity over time with now pushing 70% of the people of Taiwan say, “I am Taiwanese. And I’m not Taiwanese and Chinese. I am Taiwanese.” But Lev and Shelley and their co-authors dig deeper to try to figure out, well, what are the views towards China? What they tease out is more the sense that a lot of people in Taiwan feel great affinity for Chinese culture. Of course, Taiwan is a fairly multicultural place, including indigenous peoples. But it’s the political system which people here are adamantly crystal clear, they do not want to be a part of. I’ll say, you know, looking back to being here in 2020 for that presidential election, the deterioration, if not obliteration, of civil and political rights in Hong Kong really hit hard and was hugely helpful in Tsai Ing-wen’s reelection. That doesn’t feel quite so present in day-to-day conversation right now. But there is no way that ascent would be there anytime soon to join Beijing. Kaiser: I mean, as completely unlikely as such eventuality might be, it’s still hard for me to imagine an American politician of either party being able to stand up in front of an audience and say, “I would support peaceful unification between China and Taiwan.” Even that seems just terribly impalatable right now. Maggie: Oh, I agree. And that would be, talk about a soundbite for someone to use in a campaign ad against that person. But I don’t think that needs to be said necessarily. I would even be happy if there was clear statements about, again, this right of self-determination, which is that is what is in the One China Policy and what’s in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the U.S. is a member of, and that we’re not making decisions for the people of Taiwan. And that is short of saying, and we’re okay with one of those decisions being joining together. But of course, the U.S. politicians, not just the executive branch, but in Congress are constrained by domestic political realities. And our Chinese counterparts know that. So, I think that there’s some limits about what can be asked for. You’re not going to get a unicorn with a rainbow here. Paul: One of the interesting things about that is that the self-determination clause, if you want to call it that, was a relatively new inclusion in our One China Policy. Because when our One China Policy was forged back in the 1970s, Taiwan was neither a democracy nor was that part of the equation that either Beijing or Washington was looking at. And the report, I think, accurately and correctly outlines that this is one of the things that altered the equation over the last 40 years. It’s created some of the dilemmas we’re confronting now. Kaiser: That’s right. Maggie: I first came to Taiwan with Jerry Cohen, who, happy birthday, Jerry just turned 93 earlier this month. Kaiser: Woo-hoo! Maggie: What we were studying were vestiges of martial law in the criminal justice system and administrative law system. And in the early 2000s, you still felt that. I mean, it was only 1996 that there was the first direct presidential election. So, this is a young democracy. And that bears reminding because it’s amazing that in a quarter century, so much has changed. Kaiser: Yeah. Absolutely. Hey, so I have one more question, and I want to ask Paul, a while back, shortly after Nancy Pelosi’s visit — during another one of those sort of maelstroms around Taiwan — John Culver, who you know very well, published a piece for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in which he laid out what it was that we would see, what it is that we would see were China, in fact, preparing some kind of a military action against Taiwan. I wonder whether either of you have seen any, I mean, I assume that you both read this, it was a really influential piece, whether you’ve seen anything that he enumerated, transpire. Is there any reason, by his measure, to fear that we’ve moved closer? Paul: I don’t think so. I mean, I certainly would defer to John, but I think he would argue that he had a very specific list of indicators as the kind of operational things and diplomatic things and all kinds of other preparations that Beijing would be launching if they had decided to send a balloon up. Kaiser: Well, they did send a balloon up, didn’t they? Paul: Yeah. And we brought it down. Kaiser: Yeah. One of those conditions wasn’t the three-week disappearance of the foreign minister? Paul: No. Well, we might find out some clarity on that in the next day or two. But I mean, the reason I think we haven’t seen those things is because I still believe, and I think logic and history and the evidence still supports the idea that the Chinese are not eager or planning to use force against the island. Now, the counter-evidence that’s cited is China’s exponential and persistent military buildup, which have been described by others as simply war preparations. Well, a military buildup, yeah, you can characterize that as war preparations. That’s what militaries do. You can make the counter observation that when the Pentagon says that China is our pacing challenge, it’s the rationale for our comparable war preparations. We’re not preparing for war. We’re preparing contingency plans to be capable and ready for war. And that’s what the Chinese are doing. If they had decided that they were going to actually use force, I think we would start to see some of the indicators that John outlined, and we haven’t seen them. Kaiser: I wonder, though, if there aren’t sort of steps short of war that we haven’t maybe thought through and thought of contingencies for. For example, what would happen if they decided to put a blockade around just Kinmen, just Quemoy, and if they decided to demilitarize Quemoy to insist on its demilitarization, what would we be able to do? I wonder what we think through these sorts of contingencies. I mean; again, I’m absolutely ignorant of American military preparations for these sorts of things and military calculus, but I wonder whether somebody with your long experience in intelligence knows, might have some inkling about that. Paul: Well, I’m largely ignorant of operational and military plans, especially in the recent years. I would have to defer to operational experts like John Culver and others as to what specific capabilities we would have to counter that. But I think the diplomatic impact would be as important as the military operational impact of that. I mean, it would be immediately perceived as the Chinese having decided to use force and go for the gold in terms of affecting reunification with Taiwan, I’m not sure that it would necessarily reflect that. It might be a test of our capabilities or Taiwan’s capabilities. My guess is that there are options that we could pull off the shelf. I guess all I can say is that I’m just assuming that if our pacing challenge includes contingencies with regard to Taiwan that those kinds of scenarios are among the planning that INDOPACOM is involved in. And again, in conjunction with our allies who might participate in some way in responding to that. Kaiser: I mean, I only say this because it struck me reading the report that it seemed to think of things in a kind of a binary that it’s either war or not war, right? An invasion or not an invasion. Maggie: I’d say here on the ground in Taiwan that there is a real debate about, first of all, how immediate, what are the possibilities for different kinds of, you know, more direct action by Beijing. Of course, we’ve seen over recent years, a huge increase in the number of flights in the vicinity of Taiwan. There’s no doubt there’s been an escalation in that kind of, I’m not touching you behavior, as I think of kids in the backseat of the car. There’s a real debate about how to be prepared because Taiwan has huge vulnerabilities. Some of this is in the report that Taiwan imports nearly 100% of its energy. So, the question is, is nuclear energy going to come back? Something that KMT is raising, Taiwan has increased its conscription to a year for men. The KMT has also made some noises about whether they agree with that. And there are good questions about quantity versus quality. One thing we flag in the report, which I’m very interested in, is whether there should be more national service that requires female participation. There’s no constitutional barrier to that in Taiwan, and that’s part of the discussion. So, here, too, there’s a lot of conversations about what kind of more coercive or even kinetic warfare scenarios could play out. And just very anecdotally, people I interact with, they really vary in how much they sort of walk around with a sense of foreboding, or this is a far distant future, if anything. Paul: Actually, I think, on the point you raise, that’s incredibly important because, I mean, John Culver and others, I know, have been on the forefront of making this argument that the conventional wisdom is that if the Chinese decide to use force, it’s going to be D-day, it’s the amphibious assault. But one of my colleagues used to call it the “million man swim” across the Strait. That is probably among the least likely scenarios. China has a wide range of non-kinetic course of options that could be much more effective in achieving its goals, and in fact, has been somewhat effective already in undermining, as Maggie has said, the confidence of folks on the Taiwan side. Kaiser: Yeah, that’s why I found it so curious that there wasn’t so much discussion devoted to those other coercive, non-kinetic options available to Beijing and what our contingencies might be. In any case, you can only do so much in a hundred-page report. Paul: I was going to say, I mean, we were constrained because we didn’t have the option of making it encyclopedic, I think. Kaiser: Right. But kudos to you both for offering such, I think spirited descent. They were excellent. And those were, I think, a saving grace in many ways of the report. I would add Patty Kim’s, which was also excellent, and, of course, Danny Russel’s and Doug Paal’s, very, very good. Let’s move on now, oh, first, thank you very much for your time, and move on to recommendations. First, a very quick reminder that the Sinica Podcast is powered by The China Project, and the best thing that you can do to support the work that we do with this podcast and with the others in our network is to become an access subscriber. For a very reasonable annual fee, you get access to our daily newsletter, which is just great. Just a really, really good one, super readable, really nicely put together. Visually, very nice. We’re always experimenting with new products, so you’ll be the first to get to try them. Yeah, so onto recommendations. Maggie, why don’t you start us off? What do you have for us? Maggie: Well, I wish that I could send you all mangoes, specifically Irwin, the Irwin mangoes, and I mean, they’re always fantastic this time of year, but I’ve been told by several people that they’re particularly sweet this year because of very climactic reasons. Kaiser: El Nino. Maggie: So that’s a recommendation, but get them if you can. But one thing, my recommendation that is available to everyone everywhere is I’ve been listening to a podcast called Fever by John Sudworth, who was the BBC reporter in China for about a decade. He actually ended up fleeing here with his family in the spring of 2021. My family was in Taiwan, and they ended up coming over, and it was literally followed to the airport by plain-clothes police because he was under so much pressure, first for his reporting, his excellent reporting about Xinjiang, and then looking into COVID. Now he’s done this podcast, and it’s a multi-part podcast, looking at trying to find out the origins of COVID. And there was so much noise, Lab Leak and this, and I’ve really appreciated listening to John try to make accessible to a non-scientific audience these very complicated debates. So, I would recommend that. Kaiser: Okay. All right, I’ll check it out. Although, I’m very, very close to being unable to read another thing about COVID origins. I mean, partially because it is just so complicated, it just breaks your brain. But excellent recommendation. Thanks. All right. Paul, what do you have for us? Paul: Well, I don’t know if I can now do fresh mangoes. That’s a tough one. But I’ll cheat as usual and give you two quickies. One is I’m going to strongly recommend the movie, Oppenheimer. Not because I want to endorse the politics that has been attributed to it, but because I’m a historian, and it’s an excellent history lesson for, I think the majority of Americans who probably aren’t that familiar with this story, the details of it. It’s a very powerful cinematic experience and very thought-provoking. I mean, it’s not perfect. There’s a couple little things that grit me the wrong way, but I think it’s an extraordinary movie and it’s a must see because I think we need to understand this episode, the magnitude of it in our history, and how it still has relevance today. Maggie: Wait, Paul, did you do a double feature, Barbenheimer? That’s the question. Paul: I did not do Barbenheimer. At this stage, I’m not particularly interested in the Barbie version, the Barbie saga, I should say. Kaiser: Are you wearing your Barbie outfit there? I mean, you’re wearing hot pink right now. Maggie: I know. I’m in the spirit. And I’ve got my, even so, my hat. Paul: Oh, God. No, I didn’t do the full Barbie-Heimer. Kaiser: I am going to see it. I’m going to see it. I’ve already determined that because it’s part of the cultural conversation now, and I feel like I’d be speaking from ignorance if I didn’t see it, so I will. But Oppenheimer, yeah. I thought it was very much worth seeing. I took my history nerd daughter, and we just talked about it for an hour and a half afterward. It was great. Paul: The second thing I was going to say, as a Kennan doppelganger, I strongly recommend the new biography of Kennan by Frank Costigliola. It just came out earlier this year. I actually found it in some ways more interesting than what supposedly, or is still I guess, considered the definitive Kennan biography by John Lewis Gaddis. I think Costigliola gets more into the personality, sometimes a little more than I’m comfortable with. He even dabbles with some psychoanalysis a little bit around the edges. But I think it’s an excellent book for two reasons. I mean, well, just the topic, but I think it gives you a more human comprehension of Kennan. And it also does a really good job of drawing out the immediate contemporary relevancies of some of his ideas about the need for mutual understanding between East and West. And he’s not explicit on the China side of the equation, but I think it very much applies there. Kaiser: Looking at it right now. Yeah. I’m going to buy this. This looks excellent. Fantastic. Thank you. Another excellent book recommendation. I’ve been doing a lot of your book recommendations and really enjoying them. All right. So, mine is going to be a book recommendation as well. It’s in anticipation of an upcoming interview on this podcast. It’s really good, though, and it’s not out yet. It’s not going to be out until late August, I believe, but get your hands on a review copy if you’re able. If not, let this just be an appetite-wetting for you. It’s Yasheng Huang’s book, The Rise and Fall of the EAST: How Exams, Autocracy, Stability, and Technology Brought China Success, and Why They Might Lead to Its Decline. It’s a fantastic book. It’s one of these books that dares to take on a gigantic historical sweep, a big topic, and to make sort of bold assertions and to really kind of draw links from China’s imperial past to the present in a way that, this is Yasheng Huang, after all, we’re talking about, so, they’re well thought through. They’re very subtle and smart. It happens to also be an area that I’ve worked through myself when working on the rise of technocracy in China and looking at its relationship to the Kējǔ, to the examination system in Imperial China. I’m pretty blown away by this book. It’s really, really good. The rise and fall of the East by Yasheng Huang. Yeah, check that out. Once again, thank you to both of you for taking the time to talk with me. And please make sure to check out the CFR report. Once again, the title of the report is U.S.-Taiwan Relations in a New Era: Responding to a More Assertive China. You’ll see it’s quite the who’s who of people in the China watching space who participated in it. Thanks once again to both of you. Paul: Thank you very much. Maggie: Thanks, Kaiser. Thanks, Paul. Kaiser: The Sinica Podcast is powered by The China Project and is a proud part of the Sinica Network. Our show is produced and edited by me, Kaiser Kuo.

      "title": "The Top Shows Of Edinburgh Fringe 2023 - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "The Edinburgh Fringe is back. The biggest arts festival in the world has taken over the Scottish capital for the entirety of August. With 3,535 shows registered this year to play across the city, it can be a bit of a headache to work out what you want to see. Fret not! I’ve got up close and personal with the Fringe to find some gems for your viewing pleasure. The joy of the Fringe is the opportunity to discover something incredible to recommend to all your mates. I’ve trawled through famous comedians, circus acts, solo theatre pieces and the Free Fringe to deliver my top tips for anyone interested in seeing something a little bit different. Comedy Chloe Petts: If You Can’t Say Anything Nice One of the comedians with the biggest buzz around her this year is Chloe Petts. Fresh off a tour supporting Ed Gamble, Petts’ comedic star is in ascendance. Her new solo show, after the much-loved ‘Transience’, navigating the challenges of her anger, is hilarious and charming in equal measures. Petts is adept with the crowd, split demographically into her two kinds of fans: the “gentle queers” and the “football lads”. Both encompass the two opposing poles of her personality as a 6ft tall lesbian woman who loves nothing more than screaming at a telly when Crystal Palace are winning. She weaves tales of football hooliganism with observations of a gendered society. Chloe Petts: If You Can’t Say Anything Nice is on at the Pleasance Courtyard – Pleasance Above. Rob Auton: The Rob Auton Show Auton is something of a Fringe staple. He brought his first solo show (The Yellow Show) to the festival 10 years ago and has followed up with an array of other similarly specific shows (Hair, Sky, Sleep, and Faces). Last year, he focused his illuminating gaze on the audience with The Crowd Show. To celebrate a decade of Fringe shows, it’s only right that the time has come to focus his razor sharp poetic wit on himself. The Rob Auton Show is his most personal work yet and it might also be his funniest. The spoken word poet blends his fundamentally optimistic view of life with erudite quotidian observation, hilarious childhood anecdotes, and penetratingly earnest revelations. You’ll laugh until you cry at a glorious retelling of his circumcision coupled with a less than usual visit from the tooth fairy. You’ll be just crying by the time of his final poetic monologue. The winner of Dave’s Funniest Joke of the Fringe 2013 hits a whole new height. Catch it before it sells out. Rob Auton: The Rob Auton Show is on at the Assembly Roxy – Upstairs. Emotionally Unreasonable American comedian Maria DeCotis brings her no-nonsense New York attitude to a funny hour of jokes about the patriarchy. With a side hustle as a wedding officiant, she’s witnessed up close and personal the trials and tribulations women go through just to permanently tie their freedom and assets to… some guy named Tyler. DeCotis is a classically trained actor and it shows. While her jokes on topics ranging from abstinence to ultimate frisbee are pitch perfect, her expressive face jumps through emotional hoops to land every joke. DeCotis continuously refers to musical comedy as “kinda hack” before breaking out into hilarious songs that follow the golden rule of musical comedy: never repeat the same punchline twice. DeCotis is also performing in Before the Drugs Kick In, a darker theatre piece about a 62-year-old waking up as a 28-year-old comedian. Emotionally Unreasonable is on at the Laughing Horse @ Home Bar – Basement. Fat, Femme and Crippled Alex Gibbon has carved out perhaps the most niche comedy act of this year’s festival. Not content to let a neurological condition get in the way of a good time, the non-verbal comedian provides a tight set of laughs via a text-to-speech programme. Sat on his mobility scooter (nicknamed Miss Carriage), he glugs away at a bottle of wine as he regales the humour and hiccups that come with being a queer disabled man. His jokes are often outrageous, opening with the explanation that, no “Stephen Hawking didn’t get a perm” and it only gets filthier from there. As he rails against the cultural appropriation of TikTokkers using the same speech software as him, Gibbon brings mountains of personality to the set through great one-liners and his wonderfully expressive physicality. Fat, Femme and Crippled is on at the Laughing Horse @ Bar 50 – Garden Room. Absolute Chaos Living up to its title, Absolute Chaos is a great way to wrap up a night of revelry, or perhaps to just get it started. In its basement location at 11:30pm, compere Stuart Kennedy does his absolute best to corral a disobedient crowd into watching a selection of comedy acts. The premise is simple. Hecklers are encouraged, but any attitude from the audience will be met by equal fury. On the night I went to see it, audience members are forced on stage to prove they can do a better job, one act performs a song then proceeds to chuck copies of his CDs out in the crowd through the next, and Kennedy breaks down in laughter when someone calls him “crackhead Santa.” Go in with a thick skin. Absolute Chaos is on at the Laughing Horse @ 32 Below – Little Cellar. Theatre Anything We Wanted To Be Amid old CRT televisions, neon lights and looped beats, Adam Lenson presents a memoir of his entire life and all the other lives he could have lived. Using the multiverse as a narrative tool, he tells the non-linear story of his diagnosis with cancer. Lenson is obsessed with how the decisions we make reflect and refract into alternative timelines, each defined by the one anxiety, would he have cancer if he’d have done something differently. His ability to keep the audience oriented in his entire-lifetime-at-once plot speaks to his brilliant storytelling ability, while his wit and charm keep everything moving nicely. Alongside songs, it’s a masterfully put-together piece of multimedia theatre. In the end, “it’s not you that made choices, it’s the choices that made you.” One of my absolute favourites this year. Anything We Wanted To Be is on at the Summerhall – Cairns Lecture Theatre. The Last Show Before We Die Ell Potter and Mary Higgins hug, argue, apologise, sing, dance, and writhe their way through one of the most jaw-dropping shows of this year’s Fringe. The duo have worked together on two plays (‘Hotter’ and ‘Fitter’) that brought verbatim accounts of how gender impacted life from women and men, respectively. This time, they’ve got a new question on their minds. Why are we so bad at ending things? As they weave interview segments from palliative carers to Mary’s late grandfather, they also tell the story of their own personal ending. Higgins and Potter have made a name for themselves with their penetratingly autobiographical theatre. This piece is their most vulnerable yet as they navigate the dissolution of their own artistic collaboration. They bicker like an old married couple in between clever set pieces and even smarter deconstructions of the form. If that sounds too high-concept for you, the whole thing is anchored by both Potter and Higgins’ tight comic writing. Endings never felt so euphoric. The Last Show Before We Die is on at the ROUNDABOUT @ Summerhall. Nobody’s Talking About Jamie Jamie Finn will sing and spin his way to your heart as he tells the tragic tale of his co-dependent life. Finn’s semi-autobiographical story takes us through his break-up with Cordelia and the friendship with his spin class teacher Lily that blossomed in her absence. This tale of love, friendship and loss is kept fresh by Finn’s talent for storytelling, pinpoint wit, and knack for a good tune. The portrait he paints of his one-time friend Lily is so vivid, you wish you could meet her in real life. Nobody’s Talking About Jamie is on at the Underbelly, Cowgate – Iron Belly. Frigid Rosa Bowden delivers a blisteringly witty show on the humiliations of youth in Dublin. Set in 2007, Bowden plays Niamh O’Reilly, a 14-year-old girl who’s a bit too precocious and a bit too much of a misfit to have kissed anyone yet (or “meeted” in the local twang). Afraid of the “Frigid” moniker, Niamh must find a suitable partner at the upcoming dance. With the help of DJ Ciarán Gallagher on period-authentic decks, Bowden plays a whole host of school characters and parents to recreate an exaggerated but hyper-believable portrait of a North Dublin Mean Girls. As the adult Bowden inhabits the personas of children trying to pose as adults, she’ll make you laugh with embarrassment, then cry from nostalgia, then laugh all over again. Frigid is on at the Underbelly, Cowgate – Iron Belly. BUTCHERED For a (meaty) taste of something different, the horror-comedy BUTCHERED is one of the more unique theatre pieces of this year’s Fringe. The hour-long dialogue features grim mime-grinding galore. With the help of some particularly visceral sound and lighting design, the viscera are brought to life with gut-clenching vividity. Set in a dystopian nightmare of butch-or-get-butchered, the show feels like something out of Samuel Beckett or Robert Eggers’ The Lighthouse. Performed by Expial Atrocious, both actors Nic Lawton and Ez Holland bring committed character comedy to their gruesome double act. Their characters are part vaudeville, part nightmare and sell the horror-comedy genre well. It was a hit at last year’s Fringe and London’s VAULTS Festival. Needs to be seen to be believed. BUTCHERED is on at the Underbelly, Cowgate – Iron Belly. The Death & Life of All of Us Victor Esses presents the story of a relative he barely got to know on the other side of the world. The Jewish-Lebanese performer grew up in Brazil but found out at 19 he had a great-aunt in Rome. The piece brings together his video documentation of a woman whose deep transformation — from a Jewish-Lebanese girl to a Christian-Italian woman — with intriguing choreography, personal revelation and live music. It’s a highly personal show about identity, loss and family. The Death & Life of All of Us is on at the Summerhall – Demonstration Room. A Funeral for My Friend Who Is Still Alive Although the Fringe is best known for its showcase of British theatre and comedy, it’s also an incredible hub for international talent. ‘A Funeral for My Friend Who Is Still Alive’ is Kasen Tsui’s first solo show in the UK. Her personal tale of the disintegration of press freedoms and friendships as China tightens its grip on Hong Kong. Directed by Cathy Lam, Tsui’s performance is comical but under the surface throbs the deep pain as she recalls the process of bidding a forever farewell to the friends who choose to leave Hong Kong. A Funeral for My Friend Who Is Still Alive is on at theSpace @ Niddry St – Studio. Dance, Musicals and Everything Else Party Ghost Easily one of the most exciting of the circus acts on this year. Double Take present their macabre take on the whole gamut of circus talents. It all starts with a veiled Raphaël Herault raising himself up to the trapeze bar by a noose to perform a set of acrobatic contortions before running off stage shrieking “The will, the will, where is the will to live?” Herault and Summer Hubbard take turns bashing in each other’s heads with alarming believability. There’s a hint of ‘The Young Ones’ and ‘Bottom’ about all the damage they inflict upon each other. These sections are matched with hilarious haunting episodes with the group all decked out in ghostly white sheets. Expect gruesome laughs, impressively athletic choreography, and a music video premise Adele wishes she’d thought of. Party Ghost is on at the Assembly Checkpoint – Assembly Checkpoint. Fall and Flow Exploring traditional Chinese theatre, Kung-Fu action films and modern clown narrative, the Hong Kong Theatre de la Feuille group present a refreshingly bold piece of physical theatre. The piece takes place over a five part story of jianghu, the quasi-mythical world of wuxia in Ancient China where martial arts reigns supreme. The five performers are dressed in all black with charcoal clown face markings. They perform alongside a live musician, bringing together traditional Chinese instruments with modern stylings. It’s a bracingly original piece of dance. The troupe aren’t afraid of slapstick humour as they transport you back to the palaces and temples of jianghu. A handy cheat-sheet is given out at the start to explain the backstories of the complex cast of characters. Fall and Flow is on at the Underbelly, Cowgate – Big Belly. Losing the Plot For a bit of early-morning fun, you’d be hard pressed to find a better pick-me-up than this 80s jukebox musical. Combining all of your favourite karaoke hits, tied neatly together with an enjoyable plot about a writing team struggling to come up with a musical while under dictatorial conditions, this is a great way to shake off any lingering hangover from the night before. Losing the Plot is on at theSpace @ Niddry St – Lower Theatre. Drag Queen Story Hour It’s a peculiar feature of today’s political climate that my recommendation for this year’s best children’s theatre is arguably the most controversial of the list. ‘Drag Queen Story Hour’ has been plagued by protests from bigots in multiple cities, including a paltry eight people turning up at this year’s Fringe. It’s an unfortunate blight for one of the most joyous ways you can spend an hour of your time. Perfect for families with young children, Aida H Dee is a captivating entertainer. Her larger-than-life drag persona is a natural foil for the hyper energy of the average three year old. There’s a touch of Rik Mayall to her outrageous showmanship as she takes the kids along for her story ‘Three Goats United’. Alongside natural charisma, there are also enough knowing winks to the audience to keep the parents entertained as well. In the performance I attended, the kids were so excited by the whole thing, it rivalled ‘Absolute Chaos’ above for most raucous audience. Drag Queen Story Hour is on at the Assembly Roxy – Downstairs. The Edinburgh Fringe Festival lasts until 28 August.",

      "title": "576. BookTok, Hockey Romance, And People As Products With Kayleigh Donaldson - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "[music] Sarah Wendell: Hello and welcome to episode number 576 of Smart Podcast, Trashy Books. I’m Sarah Wendell. My guest today is former book blogger and current pop culture critic Kayleigh Donaldson. We’re going to talk about BookTok and hockey romance and the Seattle Kraken and all of what just happened, and we’re locating this conversation inside a larger discussion about fandom and fanfiction, fanfiction about real people, and the ways that celebrity culture, fan culture, and romance are intersecting. I do want to mention that we do briefly talk about Johnny Depp and his fandom and larger issues of misogyny and sexual harassment throughout this conversation. This is something that I think a lot about: how fandom has changed, how romance has changed, how readership and the way that readers talk to each other has changed, and I hope you find this conversation as interesting as I did. I am very grateful to Kayleigh for not only explaining what was going on but also explaining how to locate it in a larger sense of the community online and off. I will have links to all of the books that we mention, as well as several articles that Kayleigh has written and where you can find her online in the show notes at smartbitchestrashybooks.com/podcast.

You might recognize the name Anna Todd from her number one bestselling After series. It was a massive global hit; it was made into a movie. Her appearances overseas cause lines to form around the block of readers eager to meet her and thank her in person. But did you know she’s written a new romance trilogy? The first two books in the Brightest Stars are out now, and if you are looking for summer reading, listen up: The Falling and The Burning are available now, just in time to heat up your TBR. Set against the backdrop of a military base, both books feature emotionally powerful stories about slowly falling in love with another person and with yourself. Colleen Hoover is a big fan of Anna Todd’s heart-stopping new trilogy; she raved about the first book The Falling, saying, “Anna Todd…is my go-to for a story I know I’ll love and characters who will live in the heart long after the last page is turned.” Look for The Falling and The Burning by Anna Todd and buy your copies wherever books are sold.

All right, are you ready to talk about BookTok, hockey romance, and people as products? Let’s do this; on with the podcast! [music] Kayleigh Donaldson: My name’s Kayleigh Donaldson. I’m a pop culture writer and critic. My main stomping ground is Pajiba.com, and my main focus as a writer is on general pop culture, but specifically the intersections between celebrity gossip and celebrity culture and how we talk about famous people, essentially. Sarah: Which is actually one of my absolute favorite topics, because the way we talk about celebrities reflects so much of whatever is simmering under the surface of culture? Kayleigh: I think that’s what’s so interesting about a lot of celebrity drama as it pertains to their very ardent fans. It requires I, I would say, a certain level of infantilizing of your subject. I mean, in order to, frankly, worship a stranger who you’ve never met, I think you have to stop viewing them as human. You have to stop viewing them as being responsible for their actions, or even just part of a weird cycle, ‘cause being famous is bananas, and it’s such a fast-moving change in the way that we talk about these, like – there are a whole bunch of celebrities who are not equipped for the TikTok age. They’re still trying to deal with, you know, Twitter; they’re still trying to deal with the days when the, the magazines like People and Us Weekly ruled the roost rather than – DeuxMoi, I think, is probably the most infamous example. So the, the disconnect that you see on those fronts is so interesting, and I think a lot of people don’t really know how to deal with it, so it festers and it gets much weirder, and then when you poke the bear you kind of unleash something really dark. And I think that’s another reason I end up talking about this so much, ‘cause it doesn’t get taken seriously – Sarah: No. Kayleigh: – and I think that you see the way this stuff gets reflected. I think the Johnny Depp thing is a perfect example: it became the microcosm of a really specific kind of misogyny, of victim-blaming, of the, the backlash to what we would call #MeToo… Sarah: Yeah. The pendulum swinging back the other way – Kayleigh: Yes. Sarah: – from #MeToo. Yeah. Kayleigh: And it’s, it’s a terrifying thing to get involved with, even just like as someone who writes hot takes on the internet. Like, we got the most pushback from stuff like this from people. Like, I, we’re, you know – but, because, I think, and we also realized there weren’t a lot of websites or publications that were actually standing up and saying, We believe Amber Heard, and Pajiba, I will very proudly say, was one of them – Sarah: Oh yeah. Kayleigh: – and has been for a long time. Sarah: Oh yeah. Kayleigh: But, you know, I think one of the benefits of being an independent writer on this front: I don’t really write for, like, the big people? They, they’ve never asked me, they’ve never paid me, so there is something to be said for being like, I actually have nothing to lose on this front. I really can dig into that, and I have the, the means to do so, so that’s how you get something as varied as, like, what we’re going to talk about with everything that happened with the Seattle Kraken. Like – Sarah: Yes. Kayleigh: Like, a lot of people just dismissed out of hand this like, This isn’t a story. And it’s like, Actually, there’s a lot going on here! Sarah: Yeah. It’s just porn books about hockey! Kayleigh: Yes! Sarah: And the weird thing about fandom that I think celebrities and those who manufacture a celebrity narrative and a celebrity persona do not understand is that there is a portion of a fandom in just about every subgenre that is prepared to fall on their sword as if they are personally invested in this person, and I don’t get that. Kayleigh: So that definitely is something that worries me, and you see this tied into a lot of the worst aspects of, like, fan and celebrity culture because the general, like, the status quo, default mode that we have of how we talk about celebrity is as these people aren’t people – Sarah: No. Kayleigh: – they are products to be consumed, and that is, we definitely have seen some evolution on that front, we’re definitely getting a more nuanced conversation, but if you look at just everyday piece of gossip, the way we talk about it, that is how it is. But I think people forget just how much money remains in this field. Like – Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: – it’s so inescapable! [Laughs] Sarah: It’s, it is! It’s like this gross, toxic stew, and you can’t get out of it. So speaking of inescapable, you said a few minutes ago that these aren’t people; these are products to be consumed, which is brilliant, and I think that is the perfect way into what I wanted to speak with you about, which is the current BookTok hockey romance extravaganza of absolute weirdness. Every time I read about this it got weirder and weirder and weirder, and it was this weird, weird intersection between the people who I know who are into hockey romance, and then the people who I know are just into sports and follow hockey and have no idea about romance, and the people who are into internet culture and fandom. All of us came together and were like, What is happening here? And you wrote about it in a way that I thought really fully understood all of these different intersections, so could you walk me and the listeners through the BookTok hockey romance story as it stands now? Kayleigh: Sure! Strap in for this. So – Sarah: Hold on to your butts, people! Kayleigh: – BookTok is basically the – [Laughter] Kayleigh: So BookTok is sort of the name given to the very disparate connection of communities of people who like talking about books on TikTok. Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: It encompasses vast amounts of literature, as any book blog, you know, community would as well, but I think when people talk about BookTok in spec-, specifically and if you go to bookshops and you see signs that say BookTok Made Me Buy It, what they’re talking about is a very specific kind of book. Lot of Colleen Hoover, lot of Taylor Jenkins Reid, the real-world fanfiction written by Ali Hazelwood – basically kind of combinations of like contemporary romance, “women’s fiction,” and a sort of strain of like dark romance, I think is the title given to it. They’re very dark, kind of very boundary-pushing erotica. Sports romance, particularly ice hockey romance, is a really big part of this, and it’s seen a boom in popularity over the past few years; you see a lot of books coming in, many wonderful, punny titles like Pucked and Pucking Around and, you know, “Final Shot,” and, like, that’s the fun of it. So several months ago a book called Pucking Around by Emily Rath came out. It is a Why Choose contemporary romance about a woman and the three men and the ice hockey team that she works for having a relationship. It became a surprising hit on BookTok and on Amazon. I say surprising ‘cause the book is over seven hundred pages long, but it got a very enthusiastic response, and if something goes viral on BookTok, it tends to make a real impact on their sales. Like, this is the reason Colleen Hoover is now one of the biggest selling authors of the 2020s is because of that drive on BookTok. So you start to see a kind of community building of women in particular who, many of whom aren’t ice hockey fans and are coming to the sport through the books, and there are a number of writers and TikTokers and readers and such who are getting into this, and they start to latch onto a team called the Seattle Kraken, which is one of the newer NHL teams? Sarah: Yes. Kayleigh: Like, I think they’re only about three or four years old. Sarah: Mm-hmmm. Kayleigh: So there’s a, there’s a BookToker called Kierra Lewis who has over about 1.1 million followers on TikTok. Sarah: Wow! Kayleigh: She starts doing a lot of videos about basically the really hot guys in the Seattle Kraken, not exclusively but particularly a player called Alex Wennberg, who is a Swedish player who’s been with the Kraken for a couple of years and is indeed aesthetically a very attractive man. She starts making a lot of videos. Sarah: He’s really handsome. Kayleigh: He’s very – I mean, there’s just something in Sweden, man, like, I mean, they can’t all be Skarsgårds, but there’s got to be other ones; I respect it. She is not the only one making these videos, it should be stated, but I think there’s been a focus on Lewis for a number of reasons, one of which is she was the self-appointed Queen of BookTok. She’s using that title, and she takes a lot of credit for the BookTok community, whatever it’s called and however it’s defined, latching onto the Seattle Kraken. She makes these now-infamous and now-deleted TikToks where she is squealing over Alex Wennberg and other players like Vince Dunn. The most infamous one where she talks about Alex Wennberg, she talks about having him fill all three of her holes? Very, like, graphic; very, like, slightly tongue-in-cheek; but just extremely, like, aggressive, horny-on-main videos. They get a lot of attention; her reviews of a lot of the popular HockeyTok books get a lot of attention. Icebreaker by Hannah Grace is another example that’s currently on the bestseller list; people really like that. Eventually the Seattle Kraken social media team start playing around with this. They start – Sarah: Oh! Kayleigh: – making like essentially thirst-trap-y videos talking about how they make, they’re exclusively for BookTok now. They invite Kierra Lewis to a game, get her a BookTok Kraken jersey, and she has a sign that says “#krackmyback”, which she credits herself with creating as like the, the, you know, the step on me horny message towards the Kraken players. Sarah: And these are, these are people at work. Kayleigh: To break it down in the most mundane way, these are men at their place of work. Sarah: Yeah! Kayleigh: So there are videos of her like, if you’ve ever watched ice hockey players stretching before a game – Sarah: Oh, I have! Kayleigh: – it is very, the Ambiguously Gay Duo, like in terms of what they’re doing? Like, she is making, like, up some of these videos; it gets very viral; there’s a lot of hunger for a lot of these players, not just Wennberg, but I think he becomes the face just because he is very handsome? Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: And frankly fits a very specific ideal, I think, of what people have in their head of the hockey player romance novel protagonist. One, he’s white; two, he’s tall and has beaut- – blond, handsome, you know, like the whiteness of the hockey community is something I’m definitely going to get into. This is all like, happened a few months ago, and then over the past couple of weeks, Alex Wennberg’s wife, whose name is Felicia Wennberg, puts up some Stories on Instagram basically saying, you know, I thought this stuff was kind of funny at first. It’s now become very uncomfortable. I don’t like it when people are in our comments saying stuff like this, pict-, and on pictures of our son. It’s uncomfortable to be at a game and hear people yelling this stuff. She shares a screenshot of someone leaving the “fill all 3 of my holes” comment, and you can see that it’s on a TikTok by Kierra Lewis. And then things kind of go to shit from here, because I remember I, I read the statement – it made it to my, my, my Twitter feed – and I thought, You know what? Yeah. That makes sense. That shouldn’t cause any controversy. It immediately did. Kierra Lewis in particular gets very angry, first to see the Kraken delete the TikToks they’ve made, which were basically these thirst traps. Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: They then unfollow Lewis on Instagram, and she frankly seems more mad about that than anything else, which I think is telling. She then goes on this rant about how Felicia Wennberg is a bitch, how she’s a Karen, how she’s only doing this because her marriage is probably in trouble – Sarah: Oh dear God, here we go! Kayleigh: – and how – Sarah: Oh, here we go. Kayleigh: – yeah – she didn’t mind this when TikTok was giving her all this clout. She keeps focusing on the idea that she and BookTok are responsible for giving the Seattle Kraken clout. They’re an NHL team? Sarah: They’re fine! Kayleigh: Yeah, they’re fine! That’s a multimillion-dollar sport, and from what I understand, Seattle were waiting years for an ice hockey team. They sell out games constantly! They’re fine! Sarah: Do you remember – I have a terrible concept of time, but do you remember, I’m going to say ten to fifteen years ago, there was actually a Klout score? Remember K-L-O-U-T? Klout score? Kayleigh: God, yes! Sarah: And you would put in your Instagram – Kayleigh: Oh, that takes me back! Sarah: – and you would put in your Twitter, and it would, like, measure engagement and give you a Klout score, and then you could, like, compare your Klout score to other people’s and what topics were the most applicable to your Klout, and you wanted to have Klout above eighty. And I, the minute I hear anyone on, on TikTok talking about clout I’m like, Oh, you mean like that score thing? Yeah, that’s bullshit. [Laughs] Kayleigh: It does feel a little Black Mirror-y the way she talks about it – Sarah: Yes! Kayleigh: – and it’s clear that the Seattle Kraken did get a boost of followers from BookTok, because ultimately, like, their account doesn’t have anywhere near the same amount of followers as Kierra Lewis or a lot of these big BookTok accounts. The idea that they needed to fill out the stadium with BookTok fans to make the sales is very funny because I have friends who live in Seattle and it’s like, Look, we can’t get tickets for love nor money. I would love it if they tried to clout me into a, a ticket. So she sort of doubles down quite heavily on this and says that she’s been smeared by Felicia Wennberg. People in her comments start saying, You should get a lawyer and go for defamation. Not how defamation works. Alex Wennberg himself has to release a statement, which, if you know anything about sports people, but particularly hockey players, it’s a very stoic sport. It’s a sport where you’re basically told, Shut up and don’t say anything, and he says in his statement, I’ve been media trained my whole career to stay silent, but people have been so horrendous towards my wife and my family, and I don’t like being treated like this. I simply asked for some empathy. Felicia Wennberg releases another statement where she basically notes, I’m not singling out Kierra Lewis; this has nothing to do with her. I used this as an example because these are the comments that we see on a daily basis. If you want to say my husband is hot, that’s great; he is hot. What I don’t like is, I think the comment she makes is, I, I don’t like going to a game and wondering if someone coming up to me is a hockey fan or if they’re the people talking about how they masturbate wearing my husband’s jersey. And again, I think that’s very reasonable! A lot of Lewis’s fans barraged her comments section, saying that she was targeting, unfairly targeting Kierra Lewis, that she was being a racist Karen, that she – this wasn’t really sexual harassment because, well, you seemed okay with it at first, and they, they, they didn’t under-, seem to understand that consent can be revoked at any time. It’s a very eloquent, very astute statement – Sarah: Yeah! Kayleigh: – that notes, like, a clear difference between, like, if you want to be horny on main for my husband, that’s one thing. What I don’t like is you coming to our personal space and my husband’s professional space – Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: – and doing this. I mean, I’ve, it, it’s sort of glib to make comments like, Oh, you wouldn’t have done this for a woman, because people do do this with women, but I think you certainly notice the way that a lot of women thought that acting like a man was somehow like an empowering move on this front. I think that’s definitely like a very lazy, pseudo-feminist idea, the idea, Well, I, I, I can catcall a man – Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: – and make him feel uncomfortable while he’s working because it’s happened to me. You saw one woman defending Kierra Lewis made this TikTok where she’s like, People leave me awful comments all the time! Do you see me complaining? And I was like, You should complain! That’s awful! You shouldn’t have to go through that! That’s not an, you shouldn’t have to see it as an occupational hazard! And then this story ends up getting picked up by ESPN? It gets picked up by Rolling Stone? Sarah: Yep! Kayleigh: We were like, like, there are these pair of men on YouTube who just do hockey analysis, who are asked to commentate on it, and they look so lost! Sarah: Oh! Kayleigh: It’s like, Oh, you just want to talk about, like, you know, Larry King said, Oh, for high stakes, or, like, the game…don’t want to be talking about this! Come on! Sarah: Yeah, you want to be talking about shots on goal. You don’t want to be talking – Kayleigh: Yeah! [Laughs] Sarah: – about somebody’s spank bank. That’s what, for me, as someone who’s been writing about romance for so long, that’s when I’m just like, Ah shit, everybody get in the bunker; it broke containment. Our, our world can be very weird! Our world can be really fucking weird, and if you’re not fully fluent in all of what’s happening you can look at this and be just absolutely appalled no matter where you’re entering in. And when you, when we break containment and it goes into, like, sports journalism or tech journalism, always like, Ah shit! Well, we’ve lost control of this car. [Laughs] Everyone get off! Kayleigh: That’s one of the reasons I end up writing a lot about romance. One, because I’ve been, I used to be a book blogger, that’s how I got started, and I’ve been reading romance since, well over a decade now, because friends introduced it to me. I kind of started as a YA blogger, but, like, it is really notable when you read a report on this by someone who doesn’t know anything about romance beyond like, oh, well, there’s that Fifty Shades of Grey book, right, which I may have heard of. So I’m kind of very aware that, like, nonono, if I’m going to balance out the scales here, I’m going to do it properly. Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: The, the Rolling Stone article is actually very funny, but, like, it’s very – and they’re talking about, Oh God, these women be horny! And it’s like, you’re not wrong, but maybe there’s another way to talk about this, and I definitely felt that way about the combination of fandom, of romance, of these issues of consent in celebrity kind of – Sarah: Mm-hmm. Kayleigh: – converging in this way, because another thing about ice hockey is it’s super macho and super male. It’s also super white. Sarah: So white! Kayleigh: Like, I think one of the reasons people have jumped to hockey romance in particular is because it’s a sport of, like, first of all, it’s nowhere near as, like, celebrity-laden as, I would say, like, American football is, or like football is on my side of the ocean. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Kayleigh: The players tend to be quite private; they tend to be quite stoic. It’s a sport of a very macho culture. There’s a lot of really interesting angles to write about: toxic masculinity; about community; about, you know, finding your voice in a sport where you’re often told to shut up. Like, I totally get, like I think there’s a line between, like, the Victorian rake and the, the hockey pro as a romance hero. Sarah: Absolutely! Kayleigh: But the side of that as well is, it’s an extremely white sport, and I think, frankly, that’s why a lot of the romance community is drawn to it, because they want a sports romance, but they don’t want to read a sports romance where the sport is primarily dominated by very prominent Black men. You know, they don’t want, just, there are basketball romances, but there’s a reason it’s not bigger than HockeyTok. There’s a reason American football is not taking that on. You know, I think that’s actually very blatant, and that’s definitely – [laughs] – an issue that should be talked about. There are some exceptions, but they are exceptions, and especially BookTok is notorious for being predominantly obsessed with white books – Sarah: Yes. Kayleigh: – and white characters. Like – Sarah: Yes. Kayleigh: – I don’t think Colleen Hoover has ever written a character who isn’t white? The romance novels that tend to get sold on the booksh-, like the BookTok Made Me Do It books, all white. You know, every now and then maybe a YA book with a diverse protagonist will break through, but it’s so rare! If you want to find those books on BookTok, you’ve got to dig well beyond the algorithm. And frankly, it’s, it’s tough. It’s one of the reasons I primarily stick to Twitter, even though it’s – you know, I’m, I’m playing violin on the Titanic as that site goes down. Sarah: [Laughs] You and me both! Kayleigh: But, you know, I find it just a lot easier to curate in terms of, like, the books and the authors and the stories I want to see compared to BookTok, where I think, because it’s more personality driven and it’s so immediate – Sarah: Mm-hmm. Kayleigh: – I think that’s why a lot of these attitudes bubble up. I think that’s why you see so many women getting furious at the idea that a man and his wife wouldn’t want you to yell “Fill my holes” in a public space at them! Like, that just seems very basic! Like, I don’t feel like I should have to say that! Sarah: It’s very obvious, and it’s the same thing with Real People Fiction? There’ve been a number of books that are overtly or very discreetly ReyLo fanfic, but what they actually are is Adam Driver fic, and it makes me deeply – Kayleigh: Mmm. Sarah: – deeply uncomfortable, not only because that’s a real person, and that person has not consented to this, but that particular person has a problem with really invasive and scary fans. Kayleigh: People are horrendous towards Joanne Tucker, who is Adam Driver’s wife. Sarah: Oh, it’s heart breaking. Kayleigh: As a man who is extremely private – like, this man has gone out of his way to stay out of the headlines and has a longstanding, collaborative relationship with his wife as an actor and a charity founder, as well as them being married – I believe they now have two children, who they kept out of the spotlight for years – and the way that people project just the scariest things onto him is very disturbing to me. And I get it? Like, I am, I just read the Loretta Chase book recently for the first time? Sarah: Lord of Scoundrels? Kayleigh: Yes! I just read Lord of Scoundrels for the first time recently, ticked off the romance bucket list, and holy crap! The way these – Sarah: Ooh, you got to read it for the first time! Ahhh! Kayleigh: Yes. Yeah. Sarah: So excited for you! Kayleigh: I had a, I had this paperback copy that was literally falling apart that I’d gotten off eBay, and I was like – I bought it during lockdown – it was like, Got to get to this at some point before the book totally falls apart. Sarah: [Laughs] Kayleigh: It’s great, but also, this description of that man? That’s Adam Driver. So I get it! People are drawn to this man who looks like a Byronic hero, who plays essentially a Byronic hero, tragic antihero, in the Star Wars story. I get it! I don’t have it on me; I have Notepad, and it’s Johanna Lindsey cover art, but it’s ReyLo? I’m not a ReyLo shipper; I just like the Johanna Lindsey art. But it’s the one where, like, the woman’s on her knees – Sarah: Yep! Kayleigh: – and the guy’s totally naked. That is ReyLo like – I’m not doing myself any favors here, but I wrote a piece a few months ago for Paste about Adam Driver becoming this very big inspiration for romance characters, because there’s a book called The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood – Sarah: Yep. Kayleigh: – which I don’t, I think it started as ReyLo fic on Archive of Our Own – Sarah: Mm-hmm! Kayleigh: – and has then been published. The cover is ReyLo art; it is so clearly supposed to be Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. That book became wild bestseller, and now there is a whole stream of books being traditionally and self-published that’s ReyLo fic, but it’s not necessarily about the character of Kylo Ren. It is the projections you have of Adam Driver. Like, I received numerous press releases from pub-, from publicists over the past few months for books, like there’s a book coming out called My Roommate Is a Vampire. It’s ReyLo fic. It couldn’t, they’re not even hiding it on the cover. I’m not surprised that Star-Wars-adjacent fic and Adam Driver has become the move on this? Sarah: Mm-hmm. Kayleigh: I am a little surprised at how blatant it is? Sarah: I’m, I’m a little bit more surprised that there isn’t any sort of, Wait, does no one else have that squick line, where we’re talking about a person who is alive and is a person? Like, it, it’s not, it’s not a character. It is not a – and, and, and I understand when you’re talking about celebrity narratives? Celebrity narratives and the creation of a celebrity is about flattening someone into a narrative and flattening a person into an image, and then they have to uphold the elements of that image as, you know, as long as they are contracted to do so by being famous. That, I, I understand how it happens. But this is a person! Wennberg is a person! His wife is a person! That’s the part where I keep tripping and going, Wait! They can’t say this is okay! Kayleigh: The expectation that they should be okay with it I think is, is really dangerous, and I think that’s one of the reasons it was so telling that Alex Wennberg spoke up. Sarah: Oh, that was massive. Kayleigh: Going back to the Adam Driver case, like, what surprises me is how open the publishers and the writers are about this having been fanfiction. Used to, you used to have to go out of your way to hide that! But also, specifically appealing to it on the basis of it being Adam Driver fanfiction. I don’t even know if acceptability is the right word! Like, because they, they’ve clearly decided that financially speaking this is okay; there’s a fan base to tap into; that’s how we’re going to do it. That’s why the Kraken official social media accounts kind of latched on in a big way! ‘Cause clearly it’s like, Well! Here’s an audience we frankly don’t usually have to appeal to, which is women, which is women of color, which is queer women who are, you know, coming to the sport in a new way and want to feel welcome. Why shouldn’t we latch onto that trend? Everyone else is doing it, and frankly a lot of other ice hockey teams like the, the Chicago RacistNames are, having been doing it. There’s a lot of accounts where it’s like, Oh, hey! We’re going to get our, like, we’re going to do a TikTok where we show one of the players reading one of these books! Sarah: Mm-hmm. Kayleigh: Actually, what was really interesting about that was when ESPN covered this. Sarah: Oh God. Kayleigh: They actually talked to Emily Rath, who wrote Pucking Around. She did like a, a ten-minute TikTok on this, which was actually very astute, and I highly recommend people watch it, but she talked about how, when her book first started going viral and you saw it being latched onto by a lot of the social media accounts of actual hockey teams, she was very concerned about it, and she mentioned, I believe she reached out to one of the teams – I can’t remember if it was the Kraken – and she said, you know, this might not be something you necessarily want to feed into – Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: – and they didn’t listen to her. Sarah: Yes, there be dragons, y’all. Kayleigh: And she made a really interesting point – yes. And she made the really interesting point, it’s – let me find the quote. These, these NHL teams cannot abstract their players the way that fans do. They’re going to treat them like characters in books or treat them as if they’re fictional when they’re not. When your own company’s doing that to you, that’s where I draw the line. Sarah: Yes. Kayleigh: Yes, she reached out to the Kraken team, and apparently they just didn’t listen, and now, clearly, they’re, they’re learning from that mistake. Sarah: Like, oop! Kayleigh: ‘Cause, like, that, to me, is like, yeah, you see, like, that their teams do cheesecake calendars. They, they, you know, do interviews where they’re wearing, like, nice suits and holding a puppy to appeal to women, basically, so that’s nothing new, but I think there’s such a clear difference between, Oh, hey, isn’t our player kind of attractive? And isn’t he having fun with this? To, again, Krack My Back – Sarah: Mm-hmm. Kayleigh: – to, You’re now an object that we can push out there. Because they’re already facing a lot of crap from the typical sports fan. Sarah: Oh yeah. Kayleigh: Sports fans have absolutely no qualms about being aggressive and cruel to the players online. They have absolutely no issue with yelling, “You suck!” in the street, you know. That’s – Sarah: Oh, I’m – Kayleigh: – something they shouldn’t have to deal with, but that’s, like, so common! I don’t think they should have to add this on top of it, but this is the Pandora’s box that they accidentally unleashed, because I think they simply thought it was like doing a new meme. Sarah: Oh, for sure. Kayleigh: I think that’s how they viewed it. This is just, you know, this is like when planking was a thing or the ice bucket challenge. Sarah: Yes! [Laughs] Kayleigh: You know, this is us – Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: – just doing a silly thing that will pass. Sarah: We’re doing a meme! How much responsibility do you think the Kraken hold for this situation? Because Allegra Rosenberg wrote about this in a newsletter called “Today in Tabs,” which is basically like, Here’s what’s happening on the internet, and Rosenberg said, “The best thing a brand can hope for is that somebody else makes their product go viral without the brand having to pay for it.” And that is true for BookTok, because this is all promotion that publishers don’t have to pay for. Kayleigh: Oh, entirely! I mean, you’ve definitely seen the boost in sales like – Sarah: Oh yeah. Kayleigh: – for people like Colleen Hoover. Taylor Jenkins Reid, who wrote Daisy Jones & the Six is a really good example. A lot of romance novelists. I think that the Seattle Kraken saw a thing was going viral and really didn’t think much about it beyond, My job is to get the name out there, and this seems like a, frankly, this probably seemed perfectly innocent to them at the time, because you’ve probably logged on Twitter and seen people being horny on main. I’ve been horny on main! You know, I have, like, a number of Scandinavian character actors I’m very interested in – Sarah: [Laughs] Kayleigh: – in a totally healthy manner! So I don’t think they saw it necessarily as a big deal, and I don’t know how – like, this thing is, we don’t really know what their communication was like with the players, with the managers, all these people. Like, how much were they telling Alex Wennberg, This is for you to be leered over. Is this something you’re comfortable with? That’s probably something that’s going to happen now. I definitely understand why Kierra Lewis felt a little thrown out in that way, because she was the name. Also worth noting, she has substantially more followers than the Seattle Kraken, so the power imbalance here is really interesting. Sarah: It is a weird power imbalance, isn’t it? Kayleigh: Well, this was what was so interesting when she was like, Oh, Felicia’s going to send her people after me. It’s like, she has a, a, a fraction of the followers you do. Sarah: What people?! Kayleigh: I don’t think she’s even on TikTok! I was fascinated by people being like, Well, clearly she’s jealous of BookTok. I was like, She’s married to the guy you’re all obsessed with! Like, she’s won! She’s a beautiful, highly educated woman with a gorgeous husband who’s making bank and a very cute son, and they spend a lot of time going on holidays back to Sweden. She seems to be, she’s won it. She’s fine. You know, she has nothing to be jealous of! But I definitely wonder what the Kraken’s, like, social media will be like going forward. I think they’ve definitely now been given the message of stick to sports? Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: Which, you know, is your thing! Like, I think a lot of these teams are trying to capture that very gritty essence of Can we be a level of, like, genre-crossing chaos that creates a character, that creates a personality that goes beyond the sport? Before I became a full-time writer I, I worked in running social media accounts for people. It’s a hard job. Sarah: Oh, it’s a very hard job. Kayleigh: And this was before everyone was expected to have, like, a personality where it was like, Hey, are you suffering from the crippling depression of being a millennial? Buy my steak! I didn’t have to do that; my job was pretty bad, mercifully, but it’s a weird, very fast-moving industry to try and be a part of, and I think, frankly, the Kraken just got caught up in it. It’s a tough field, but I think that ultimately, like, the Seattle Kraken is going to be fine, regardless of how many Instagram or TikTok followers they – you know, they are a sports team! Sarah: They’re – Kayleigh: And they’re in a city – Sarah: – fine. Kayleigh: – with a very loyal fan base, and they seem to be doing quite well from what I, I’ve heard. I only just got into ice hockey this year, and ice hockey is, like, not a thing really in the UK. It’s extremely niche here? I happen to live in a city that has an ice hockey team – Sarah: So cool. Kayleigh: – but our, like, the average player – yeah, go Dundee Stars! – but the average, like, attendance, like, it’s the local ice, ice rink next to the cinema where I used to go skating with my parents – Sarah: [Laughs] Kayleigh: – and it gets maybe like four, five hundred people a game. It’s nothing compared to what the Kraken are getting, or the Maple Leafs or the Flyers or all of these things. This, the culture’s very different; it’s way less macho? Like, I go to games; it’s, it’s like sixty percent women and children, and people just drinking their, you know, their beer and eating their chips and curry sauce and getting very, and enjoying themselves! Yeah, like, that, that, that’s my kind of sport! I want to be able to get a beer, a bowl of chips covered in cheese and curry sauce, and then I want to be able to, like, you know, chill. So – [laughs] – I will say, the funniest ever insult I ever heard was at an ice hockey game when, before they start games, the Stars have, like, someone saying, This is a family friendly sport! Please don’t swear! So people just start yelling, like, adjectives and nouns? But one woman yelled at a player, Your, your dad sells Avon, and your mother never liked you, and I have never met a better insult in my life. Sarah: Ouch! Kayleigh: Yeah. [Laughs] I’m saving it! One day I will write a book and put that in there; I’m fucking serious! Sarah: Ouch! Oh my God! Kayleigh: I was sitting like two seats down from this woman, and I fully just went, Och! [Laughter] Sarah: Oh! Crying out loud! Okay, first of all, I want to go to a, a Dundee Stars game because that sounds amazing. Zooming out a little bit, what do you think contributes to so many people in this particular situation losing sight of another person’s humanity? Like, is this just the result of all of these other things? Kayleigh: Please, I think it’s actually very easy to convince yourself that what you’re doing is totally fine. But the boundaries of what classifies as, like, fandom and, like, the specific kind of safety that that spot used to offer – Sarah: Mm-hmm. Kayleigh: – those boundaries are far more liminal now. Like, I, when I was a teenager, which was not that, it was like fifteen years ago, but, like, when I was teenager, which feels several eras of fandom ago, we were taught, don’t touch the poop. Don’t break the fourth wall. Don’t poke the bear. Your community is your community. Like, when I was a teenager I was really obsessed with Whose Line Is It Anyway? so I, my fandom was like the people who wrote Whose Line Is It Anyway? thing – fandom and fanfiction, and the rules were always very clear: don’t go on Twitter and tell these people what you’re writing. Don’t – Sarah: No. Kayleigh: – spread around – this is our little LiveJournal locked page. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, basically. And we were always told very specifically, you don’t try and profit from your fanfiction because it’s eventually going to spoil everything for everyone else, because copyright take-down notices will be filed. That’s happened! Plenty of major writers did say – you know, for a very long time Anne Rice was super anti-fanfiction. She did change her tune as she got older, but there was a period of time where you just did, if you wrote, like, Interview with the Vampire fanfiction, you had that under lock and key, you know. Sarah: Oh yes. Kayleigh: But you know, I think Fifty Shades of Grey has a lot to answer for on this front. It became – Sarah: [Laughs] Kayleigh: – not only acceptable – I mean, I remember after that book became huge the influx of TwiFic. Christina Lauren, the duo behind that, they started writing Twilight fanfiction. They’re now fairly big authors who write a lot of very good books! They spun that into something – more than E. L. James did, but that’s a whole other topic. Sarah: [Snorts] Kayleigh: But I think you definitely got the sense that people were waiting for the next thing they were allowed to do. Now, with Twilight, like, those are fictional characters, but then after that a book called After comes out with Anna Todd, which is a Wattpad fanfiction with a self-insert character and Harry Styles from One Direction. That becomes the most read thing on Wattpad, it gets a publishing deal, it sells a lot of copies – Sarah: Oh yeah. Kayleigh: – it gets turned into, I believe, three films? It’s like a full trilogy of films that you can now watch on Amazon. They don’t hide the fact this is Harry Styles, and his, like, male friends are all the other guys in One Direction. They don’t try to conceal that. They don’t make it an active part of the marketing process, but everyone knows. People ask Anna Todd about it in interviews, and she talks about it. She’s not hiding it. And because no one sues and because no one, and Harry Styles’ team don’t speak up – Harry Styles has always been very, quite guarded in his private life. He doesn’t talk about these things, and I honestly do not blame him for that. I think whatever he said would just add fuel to a fire anyway. The best thing he can do is just go live his, like, adorable, tattooed life. After that, I think you really see a sense of people trying to find the next fandom thing to latch onto. I’m actually surprised it didn’t happen sooner, because I, I really was expecting ReyLo stuff to blow up much quicker than it did. I, I frankly expected more things to come out of stuff like Supernatural; I’m surprised that didn’t happen. Sherlock, actually; I’m surprised it didn’t happen because you could probably get away with that just by saying, Oh, it’s public domain, ‘cause Sherlock Holmes is in the public domain, but, you know, that mercifully never happened. That fandom has enough to deal with. [Laughs] And you definitely see a lot of this with TikTok. One of the reasons Alex Wennberg got really big on, like, the BookTok section of, with, with hockey romance was people were, essentially it’s fan casting him, but using him openly as inspiration for their characters. And there’s nothing un-, like, unexpected or unusual or new about that. Like – Sarah: Mm-mm! Kayleigh: – if you’ve ever read a Goodreads review, there are plenty of people who put in reviews, they’re like, here’s pictures of how I imagine these characters. People have done it on their blogs for years. Like – Sarah: Yeah! Kayleigh: – any writer has Pinterest where they do this; this is nothing new. Sarah: Right. Kayleigh: But I think the volume of it and the kind of, This person did it, therefore I can do it, and then this person did it, therefore I can do it, and it just sort of opens up this stream, and because there’s so much money in it – Sarah: Oh yeah. Kayleigh: – no one is really stopping to think, Are we crossing a line here? Because I definitely think the ReyLo stuff, Adam Driver, I think is so crossing a line that it makes me very uncomfortable, and I’m, I think it’s, I’m not even necessarily against Real Person Fic. If you’re just like, Here I am in my little community doing my thing. Sarah: Right. Kayleigh: What I don’t like is when it becomes fuel for conspiracy. Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: And I think that is, it’s often tough to extract those two things from one another. Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: It’s really easy to feed an, a burning fire, and it’s really hard to quash it once it gets to a certain size. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Kayleigh: And if you’re in – quite frankly, I think a lot of people who are in publishing who are picking it is they’re not seeing all of that. What they’re seeing is, here’s a, trying to make money on it; this is the exact same thing when, you know, Twilight was big and everyone wanted a vampire book. It’s the same thing when Fifty Shades was big and everyone wanted erotica. It’s the – I think that’s their beginning and end of it. So I don’t even know if they’re necessarily aware of what was happening on, on hockey side of BookTok. I think they, you know, because a lot of those books were self-published – Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: – and a lot of those books are kind of fostered very much as an indie quality – like, I think Emily Rath is a self-published author – so I don’t think they were even seeing that – Sarah: No. Kayleigh: – but I also don’t think that they are necessarily going to confront any of this. Like, what it will take is, frankly, someone doing what Alex and Felicia Wennberg did and saying – Sarah: No. Kayleigh: – Enough is enough. And they didn’t even say it about the books. That’s fine; they were talking about the fan behavior at his place of work. No one – Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: – has actually said, I don’t want you using my personal life, my personality, my family, and, like, details about my very being in this way. Sarah: And now I have to sort of chase my own tail and question where my lines are, because I don’t have a problem with fan casting. I don’t have a problem with using a still of a celebrity or a still of an actor or a, or a sports person. You know, I don’t have a problem with any of that as fan casting in a review, talking about who you see as these characters. Like, that’s not how my brain works. But I don’t have a problem with that. So why do I have a problem with Real People Fiction in romance casting, casting people, not a role, not like Kylo Ren, not, you know, a, a, a role, a fictional character, but casting the actor. Like, why is that the line for me, but not the picture? So I really have to, like, chase my own tail – Kayleigh: Well, yeah – Sarah: – and question my own boundaries here. Kayleigh: I think that’s another reason that stuff like this kind of goes unchecked is because, frankly, everyone has a different line, and it can be very difficult to define where your line in the sand is. Like I said, I read way too much Real Person fanfic as a teenager to really have a moral high ground on this. Sarah: [Laughs] Kayleigh: So when it comes to things like, you know, the, the, the Adam Driver influx of, like, fiction in that way, that, to me, like, the, the profit of it I think is what gets me. The, the latching onto a man’s name to make money from him in a way that he has not consented and in a way that feels extremely objectifying – Sarah: Yeah. Kayleigh: – I think that’s another thing about this. It’s like they can talk all they want about, Oh, I like Adam Driver for more than just his looks, but that doesn’t really come across in your work! And if you were writing, like if you were on Archive of Our Own just writing this, you’d be fine! I, I’d go past, I wouldn’t click on it, but that’s your thing, you know. That, but I, I, I do struggle with this, and I think that was one of the reasons that they, they, the HockeyTok thing fascinated me so much was because to me that seemed like such a clear line in the sand – Sarah: Mm-hmm. Kayleigh: – and I was curious as to why it wasn’t for all of these people being so sexually aggressive towards them in real life and online and feeling offended when the guy’s wife says – Sarah: Please stop. Kayleigh: – I don’t want my son growing up where thinking this is okay. ‘Cause that’s a good lesson to learn! You know, she’s doing the right thing there! Sarah: Mm-hmm! Kayleigh: And that’s so tragic to me! Like, she shouldn’t have to go through that. Where do they go after this? ‘Cause clearly a bunch of people, they’ve already said, I’m not going to support the Kraken anymore. They’re, they’ll be fine without you. So, you know, where do they move onto next? I think this is another aspect of, like, toxic fandom and the way conspiracies play that is so telling is they jump ship frequently and take that rhetoric and take that poison to other places. The TwiMoms, the people who were obsessed with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, they all jumped to Fifty Shades of Grey, then they all jumped to Outlander and replicated those same models. Sarah: Holy cow. Kayleigh: They’re the same people saying Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan are secretly in love and that her baby is really his and she – Sarah: Oh! Kayleigh: – didn’t really marry this other man – Sarah: Those poor people! Kayleigh: – and she had to, she just, and she was in an interview I think with Vanity Fair where she fully said, This is scary to be around. I feel unsafe for myself and my child. Didn’t stop these people from spreading this stuff; nothing will. But you know, Outlander is ending soon; where do they jump ship to next? Like, I’m, I’m actually trying to predict where I think they’ll jump ship; I’m curious. Like, I’m actually surprised more of them haven’t jumped ship to Bridgerton, but – Sarah: There’s just too many people there. Kayleigh: – I think that might have too many, like, non-, too many non-white people in it for their liking. So I think maybe they will jump ship to something a bit more based on real people, like, what’s the next sport? What is the next TV show? What is the next influencer? There’s always more content on the table. There will always be endless stream of it for you to vulturize. And that is a lot to deal with. Sarah: It really is. So I always ask, are there any books you want to tell people about? And where can people find you? Kayleigh: Hmm! So I mentioned earlier that I read Lord of Scoundrels for the first time, so I’ve been trying to tick off a few, like, romance novel bucket list titles? I just read Vision in White by Nora Roberts for the first time recently – Sarah: Oh! Kayleigh: – which is a delight! Sarah: I love that book! Kayleigh: I’m a sucker for a beta hero. I’m a sucker for, like, a sweet, nerdy guy who’s unsure of himself, and I don’t see enough of that in the books I read, and Vision in White has the perfect one called Carter. I love him. Sarah: I loved Carter so much. Kayleigh: I’m also reading – oh! I want more of that. I’m trying to fill in more of my, like, Nora Roberts gaps, ‘cause I just, I’ve, I’ve read about four books of the J. D. Robb series now, just to, you know, I’m filling in some gaps. I’m also reading Homicide and Halo-Halo by Mia P. Manansala. I, I hope I pronounced that correctly. It’s a cozy mystery about a Filipino-American woman who works in her family’s restaurant, and then murder happens, and it’s the second in the series, and what makes it different from that typical genre is the char-, the lead is dealing with the trauma of having watched someone die in her family restaurant – Sarah: Yes. Kayleigh: – and having to now carry that weight, and I think that book does that so incredibly well. I, I’m really very taken with it. I’m constantly trying to find more crime novels to fill the gap in my heart left by Louise Penny, who writes the Armand Gamache books, ‘cause I’ve read almost all of them now. The only cop I will ever love; they are the perfect criminals. [Laughs] Yeah, I try to, like, read, when I read a book I try and read something that’s the absolute opposite of it after I’ve done it, so, so I’ve got my cozy crime, and then I have my romance, and then I’m currently also reading about the history of the Marquis de Sade – Sarah: As you do! Kayleigh: – which is digging into his life, which – I also, I, I had a real craving for, like, early to mid-2000s urban fantasy. You know, the ones where it’s like a hot woman on the cover with a tramp stamp and a knife and a halter top, and it was like – Sarah: And leather pants. Kayleigh: – I need it. Yes! Leath- – Sarah: Always having leather pants. Kayleigh: Low-slung leather trousers, some sort of tribal tattoo – Sarah: Yep. Kayleigh: – a knife. You know, maybe she’s got a motorbike. So I read Minion by L. A. Banks, which I’m annoyed ends in a cliffhanger, but I really liked the worldbuilding of that, and it’s also a depressingly rare example of that era where the character, the protagonist is a woman of color, so I really liked the worldbuilding of that. And another one I ticked off my, my literary bucket list is I started reading Discworld! Sarah: Oh, how cool! Where did you start? Kayleigh: So this was the thing was I’d always wanted to read Discworld, and then every time I’ve asked my friends who’ve loved those books, Where do you start? Every single one of them had a different one, so – Sarah: Always. Kayleigh: – overwhelming; not going to do this. I don’t know if you can see it from here; I have a shelf on my house that is entirely Phantom of the Opera books? Sarah: Ooh, wow, look at that! Kayleigh: And retellings of Phantom, so, and it’s got films and all these books, so I bought Maskerade, which is his Phantom of the Opera pastiche, and I had it sitting on the shelf for a while for the collection, and I thought, You know, I’m just going to read it, and, like, maybe this’ll be a good start. And it was like, oh, this is really funny and charming, and these witches are like the coolest women I’ve ever read! And the satire of this is incredibly hard-hitting, so I read that, and then I read the follow-up book, which is called Carpe Jugulum, which is about vampires, and I really like vampires, and that’s great, ‘cause that book is basically like Political Centrism Is Evil: The Novel? Sarah: Yes! Kayleigh: And it’s so scathing! I was like, How are you doing this? This man is brilliant! So I’m really excited to delve back into more of those, once I finish reading the – I have a little, like, moat of books around my bed – Sarah: [Laughs] Kayleigh: – that I haven’t read yet because I don’t have shelves – Sarah: Moat! Kayleigh: – to put them on? So I have to, like, carefully extract myself from bed in the morning, not to knock over the moat. Sarah: [Laugh] Kayleigh: And so it’s really like, it’s like a yoga move to get out of bed in the morning, so it’s, you know, I quit fizzy juice, so this is the only addiction I have now is – [laughs] – books. Sarah: Well, there you go! Where can people find you if you wish to be found? Kayleigh: Well, you can find me on the sinking hellship of Twitter @Ceilidhann; it’s C-E-I-L-I-D-H-A-N-N. I’m on a bunch of other places, but I’m, again, I’m, I’m moving the deck chairs around while the ship goes down, and Elon cannot get rid of me that easily. I write a bunch of places everywhere. I’m most commonly found on Pajiba.com. I also have a newsletter called the “Gossip Reading Club” where, when I feel like it, I take a piece of celebrity reporting and I analyze it and dig into why it was important, what it was getting at, the legacy of it. My most recent piece is on the New Yorker profile of Jeremy Strong that caused a weird amount of controversy by not taking him all that seriously as a Method actor and being like, This is kind of silly, and people were like, How dare you hurt my precious baby girl Kendall Roy, so that was very fun to dig into. Sarah: Yes. Kayleigh: So yeah. Come, you know, come follow me; come read my stuff. I write about basically everything. [Laughs] Sarah: Thank you so much for doing this interview. This has been a flipping delight. If you ever want to come back and talk about book and gossip, would you please email me – Kayleigh: Hell yeah! Sarah: – ‘cause I would be delighted. Kayleigh: Yes. Hell yeah. Sarah: I would absolutely be fucking delighted. Kayleigh: If there’s anything you want to talk about with me, I will do it. This was great fun. [music] Sarah: And that brings us to the end of this week’s episode. Thank you so much to Kayleigh Donaldson for walking us through the entire story and also locating it in a larger history of fandom, including some elements that I had not considered. I will have links to all of the articles that Kayleigh mentioned that she’s written, and I will also have links to all the books that she mentioned, plus where you can find her on Pajiba, on Twitter, and the “Gossip Reading Club,” which I highly recommend; it is a great newsletter. As always, I end each episode with an absolutely dreadful joke. This joke comes from Bull – hi, Bull! – from our Patreon. Strap in. Are you ready? What’s it called when a book is written by the entire Hivemind? What’s it called when a book is written by the entire Hivemind? An ant-ology. [Laughs] Ant-ology. Ant-ology! Thank you, Bull! I love the bad jokes channel; it’s my favorite one! On behalf of everyone here, we wish you the very best of reading. Have a wonderful weekend, and we will see you back here next week!

      "title": "‘One Piece’ Star Emily Rudd Says “The Spirit\" of Eiichiro Oda's Original Manga Is \"So Strong\" in Netflix Adaptation",
      "text": "Get ready to set sail, Straw Hat Pirates! In celebration of the 10-day countdown to the anticipated release of Netflix‘s One Piece live-action series, the streamer has shared a behind-the-scenes look at the making of its new adaptation of Eiichiro Oda’s popular manga. The exciting, nearly four-minute clip introduces the cast and creators of the adventure comedy and offers commentary from each, including fan-favorite Emily Rudd, who plays navigational expert Nami. Describing the series in a Netflix interview filmed last summer, before the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild of America strikes, Rudd says the story is about “adventure” and “found family.” The actor also shares that Nami is her favorite character. “She’s the cool, calm, and collected cat burglar of the group,” the Fear Street actor explains. “It’s been truly amazing playing this role.” Rudd continues to say that “the spirit” of One Piece is “so strong” in the eight-part series. Taz Skylar, who plays chain-smoking chef Sanji, echoes her, sharing, “The original IP material is the thing that makes it so great and all of us want to honor that.” One Piece is an incredibly well-known franchise that has spun 106 graphic novels – the latest issue released on July 4, 2023 – and over 1000 episodes of an anime series, and with that territory comes overprotective fans. The live-action adaptation seems dedicated to mitigating potential blowback by welcoming Oda as an executive producer, and many of the cast and crew members are fans of the source material. In the behind-the-scenes video, showrunner Matt Owens says, in making the series, he wants to “bring the manga into a new medium and new audiences.” At a One Piece event in June, Rudd spoke with Decider about her upcoming role, during which she gushed about her costars and being part of the series. “I truly can’t put it into words. I feel like I’m done. What could possibly be next? If I had to stop here, I’d be like, ‘This is good enough for me,'” she shared. “I’m really proud of the show we made. We made a nerd show — a good nerd show. A show made by nerds, for nerds.” Speaking about her costars, Rudd said she spent the most time on set with Iñaki Godoy, who plays pirate captain Monkey D. Luffy. “We all kind of spent time with each other equally, but I spent a lot of time with Iñaki [Godoy] and we definitely developed this older sister/younger brother dynamic. He’s 19 and I am not, so I felt a little protective of him,” she said. “Also, he’s so energetic, so playful — it’s infectious. We created silly little bits that we just milked to death.” In July, concurrent with the release of the trailer, Oda published a letter to fans saying there were “no compromises” during the making of the live-action series. He went on to share that he’s unbothered about hateful comments coming from his fanbase. “I’m sure I’ll hear about some people pointing out how this character is missing or that scene is omitted, or this bit is different from the manga. But I’m sure they’ll come from a place of love, so I intend to enjoy even those comments,” Oda explained. One Piece follows Monkey D. Luffy, a young dreamer, as he leaves his small village in search of treasure and assembles a talented pirate crew to help him on his journey to become King of the Pirates. Per Netflix, the journey will include, “finding a ship to sail, searching every inch of the vast blue seas, outpacing the Marines, and outwitting dangerous rivals at every turn.” One Piece premieres August 31, 2023 on Netflix.",

      "title": "Exploring What it Means to be Human (Or Not) at the Biennale Danza 2023",
      "text": "Andrea Peña and Luna Cenere were having a drink together last fall in Naples when they both learned the good news. The young choreographers had first met at the 2022 internationale tanzmesse nrw in Düsseldorf, Germany in August and had reconnected when Peña came to Cenere’s hometown a few months later for an artist residency. But that night, when they both received career-changing news, they didn’t say anything to each other about it. The announcements were still under wraps, and they had no idea their paths were about to cross yet again this summer at the 17th International Festival of Contemporary Dance. Part of La Biennale di Venezia, one of the most prestigious cultural institutions in the world, Biennale Danza 2023 took place this July in Venice and encompassed the work of more than 150 artists and 24 events with 19 premieres—7 World, 3 European and 9 Italian—plus workshops, open classes, interdisciplinary activities and interactive learning initiatives. It drew 11,800 spectators, up 26 percent from the previous year. Titled Altered States, this year’s Biennale Danza was the third to be directed by internationally renowned British choreographer Wayne McGregor CBE. In his opening presentation, McGregor described the artists selected for the festival as “movement alchemists,” describing their work as “driven by an insatiable curiosity to explore and experiment both in process and performance; through improvisation, soma-sensory installation, radical minimalism or with surprising departures of form and context.” Thanks to an increase in resources this year for the Dance Festival (as well as for the Biennale’s Music and Theatre Festivals), La Biennale was able to commission, produce and co-produce more new productions than ever before. They put out an open call for national and international artists and dance companies under the age of 35 to present original and previously unseen choreographic works. In addition to a healthy production grant, the award covered all costs for staging the debut of the work in Venice, from production specifications and the artists’ fees to travel and lodging expenses. The two winners of that open call for promising young choreographers—two of the most insatiably curious of all the movement alchemists—were Peña and Cenere. Andrea Peña’s BOGOTÁ (2023) “I like to say that BOGOTÁ is a work inspired by Bogotá but is not about Bogotá exactly,” Peña told me. She spoke to me from Lisbon, Portugal, where she was taking a much-needed vacation with her family after the Festival. BOGOTÁ—the second large-scale piece she has created for her multidisciplinary company Andrea Peña & Artists (AP&A)—was chosen by McGregor as the winner of the international call for a new choreographic work for its “radical and innovative proposal” and its “brave and raw approach to new movement exploration and hybrid forms that explore the notions of death and resurrection, through a post-industrial, queer and Latin American baroque lens.” It had its World premiere at the Festival on July 13. “It took me about a year to come to terms with myself that I wanted to make a piece about death and rebirth,” Peña said, “because I was like, wow, those are really big themes to handle choreographically and creatively for a while. But I accepted that journey, and I said, okay, let’s go.” Her interest went beyond the traditional notions of death and rebirth. She wanted to explore how, as human beings, we constantly go through cycles of transformation, and how our energy shifts through those transformations. Part of her interest in these topics, she came to realize, was rooted in her Colombian heritage and culture—its history of colonization and violent internal war, its proximity to death and its extreme resilience. A bicultural artist, Peña was born in Colombia in 1990 and is now based in Montreal, Canada. She “hopped around a lot,” moving to Toronto with her family when she was young, then back to Colombia, then to Vancouver, to San Francisco, then back to Vancouver. Through all these moves, she danced. Those who’ve seen Peña’s genre-defying work might be surprised to learn she is a classically trained ballerina, but she very much is. She started dancing at Ballet Anna Pavlova in Bogota, “doing Nutcracker, Sleeping Beauty, all these very emotional ballet things.” She went on to dance professionally with Ballet BC, then moved to Montreal to work with Ballets Jazz Montréal, but during her first year with the company, she tore both of her menisci and fractured a rib, ending her performance career. At age 23, Peña “quit dance,” assuming she’d never return and went back to school to study industrial design. She also began working in the fashion industry. When she eventually returned to the dance field as a choreographer, all these aesthetics and skill sets merged and “little by little, through the last nine years, have been sewing themselves into what is AP&A.” Though Peña enjoys taking her time to build her multidisciplinary pieces, she only had seven months to complete BOGOTÁ, her most ambitious work yet, before it would premiere at the Festival. All the elements had to come together at once: the visual design, the costumes and lighting and set, the sound score and, of course, the choreography. “Choreography can sometimes really be built from the top down,” she explained. “I remember saying to my team, I wanted to build a piece from the back door and from the bottom up.” It wasn’t an easy process, but it was worth it. Her bottom-up approach looked like this: Together, Peña and her “interpreters” (“I never refer to them as ‘dancers’. I always say, Guys, leave your dancer at the door. I want to know who you are.”) would create a movement “system” she would then sculpt further and put inside improvisations to create “situations.” These “situations” eventually linked to create a sort of movement score. Once that score was complete, they spent three weeks undoing everything: “exploding the piece, breaking it apart, exploring what things could be based on what we already created.” And then they spent the two weeks before the premiere “piecing everything back together” into a clear blueprint with enough elasticity to allow for choices in real time during the performances. The interpreters/“amazing human beings on stage” included François Richard, Jean-Benoit Lebrecque, Frederique Rodier, Erin O’Loughlin, Charlie Prince, Nicolas Bellefleur, Jontae McCrory, Chi Long and Jo Laïny Trozzo-Mounet—an eclectic group both in dance background/training and nationality/ethnicity. BOGOTÁ’s set design is—unsurprisingly, considering Peña’s professional background—stunning. Even the teaser is a work of art. She worked with designer Jonathan Saucier to create an industrial landscape with scaffolds on the stage, a pile of speakers and piles of light. There are big white bags you’d normally see filled with concrete that are instead filled with pebbles that the dancers are interacting with. She wanted the space to feel post-industrial but also hint at the wildness of the Amazon. The venue, Arsenale Tese dei Soppalchi, a huge old warehouse with brick walls “that literally crumbled when you touched them,” added to the atmosphere. There were two big doors that opened to the water and “for the first half an hour of the show, the sunset was bouncing off the water to the brick walls. It was insane. It was so beautiful.” The musical score, composed by sound artist Debbie Doe, echoes what the choreography and set and even the sunset are doing—a layering of light and shadow, of the sacred and the profane, ancient and contemporary. Woven throughout the electronic soundscape are recordings of birds in the Amazon, flutes played in the Andes mountains and the voices of the indigenous people Peña connected with while there. There are modified Gregorian chants and—right in the middle of this complicated, beautiful aural experience—the Colombian National Anthem. In the performance, after the anthem finishes, Peña comes onto the stage to mop up the dancers’ sweat. This interruption was not part of the original choreography but instead was added during one of the rehearsals when she noticed the pools of sweat on the stage and worried her team would slip and injure themselves. She came down from the light booth, got on her hands and knees and wiped it all up. This became an important act for her—symbolizing her gratitude for the artists and deconstructing her role as choreographer while paying homage to female Latin American immigrant labor. There are other moments of note in this challenging, gorgeous 90-minute piece—when the audience enters into an “always-already space” where they get the sense that they are interrupting the not-yet-begun performance, when the performers spill themselves across each other in Baroque poses, when they climb up the scaffolds and fall off again and again—but this is the one that I keep coming back to. To me, this is the heartbeat of BOGOTÁ. Luna Cenere’s Vanishing Place (2023) From her home base in Italy, Cenere told me she is not interested in making people uncomfortable. Instead, she hopes to put them in a state where they feel very confident looking at it. By it, she means the naked body, which all her work features. Vanishing Place, the winner of the Italian call for a new choreographic creation that had its World premiere at Teatro Piccolo Arsenale on July 21, is no exception. McGregor said that “with Vanishing Place, Luna Cenere… continues her research on the naked body, posture, object, landscape and gesture, in startling dialogue with one another—piercing the very heart of what it is to dance.” So, what does it mean to dance? What is dance? Who, exactly, is dancing? Cenere and I talked a lot about these things during our deeply philosophical conversation. She is not only interested in looking at the human body as a landscape and at nudity as “a necessary condition,” but also the act of “disappearing to let the body speak.” The concept is inspired by the text The Invisible Actor by Yoshi Oida and Lorna Marshall, and actor Peter Brook’s method of having the actor “disappear” to allow the performance to appear. It’s about dissolving into the movement, she clarified, not out of it. Cenere strives to abstract the naked body so it can become something else on the stage, something that is not merely an anthropomorphic form, but also “collective memory, suggestion for the spectator, an element of the landscape in which everybody sees something.” To help with this abstraction, her choreography often hides the dancer’s face and front, which might distract and embarrass the audience. While Peña asks her performers to leave their inner dancer at the door, Cenere asks hers to shed the self. And while Peña’s approach to contemporary dance has a post-ballet/industrial design/bicultural sensibility, Cenere is steeped in the European experimental dance world. Cenere was born in 1987 in Naples and returned there after training at the Salzburg Experimental Academy of Dance and working in Brussels, Belgium for several years. In many ways, Vanishing Place is a continuation of the concepts she has been working on for many years: the abstraction of the nude body and the practice of disappearing, with a preference for adagio movement. Many of the dancers—Marina Bertoni, Francesca La Stella, Ilaria Quaglia, Davide Tagliavini, Luca Zanni—had worked with her before, so were familiar with her approach. She was pleased with the group dynamic and very grateful for how they worked together and supported each other in what might feel like an emotionally, if not physically, risky endeavor. Cenere’s creation process is also collaborative, though a bit more top-down than Peña’s. First, she shares her specific disappearing/meditative practice, which involves slowing down, focusing on the breath and mapping the body. “I’m always inviting them to use the breath in order to feel the connection between one movement and the other.” And then she shares some rules. “The basic rule is very simple,” she explained. “It’s never go back.” When they are improvising and creating new material, she asks them to never ‘go back’ in the movement, but to “always process something and then go on.” The same rule is translated into the space: the bodies make logical paths across the stage, always aware of each other but moving in their own trajectories. Because they are working with nudity and the meditative practice, Cenere records rehearsals so everyone can see what they’ve done. The dancers are often in such an intensely concentrated state that they are unaware of how they appear. Angles get tweaked, set pieces are rearranged and gestures are added (“I’m very obsessed with the use of the hands, how you touch the space, how you move the space.”) until everyone feels comfortable and confident in their experience. Vanishing Place plays with the idea of disappearing not only mentally but also physically. Body parts hide and seek behind five panels (created with designer Raffaele di Florio) that the dancers move around the space throughout the performance. For the first 20 minutes of the 50-minute piece, dancers conceal their heads behind the panels while crossing the stage and the effect is uncanny. There were moments when my visual perception tripped—when an arm became an elephant trunk, a curled back became a snail shell. It’s not just the dancers who slow down. It’s hard to watch Cenere’s work without entering a kind of meditative state yourself. The piece also deals with dreams and memories, “something that is there and it’s not there.” (I couldn’t help but think of Peña’s “always-already space,” and how these spaces are in conversation with each other.) Movements never end. Time morphs and ceases to make sense. Giulia Broggi’s saturated lighting feels almost psychedelic. Composer and electro-acoustic musician Renato Grieco’s score accompanies the dancers as they seem to float across the 6×6 white carpet in a black box. It’s often unclear what—music or movement—is leading what. Cenere and Grieco worked together to create an “evanescent atmosphere that makes sense, but it doesn’t completely make sense… where the same sounds, they come back, like when you are in a dream and you constantly come back, or when you fall asleep, you wake up and then you fall asleep again, and you are again into the same dream. Or even when you dream of someone and you don’t know this person, who is this person? You cannot really recognize it, but you give it a name sometimes.” All of these elements—the bare bodies, the tilting panels, the haunting sounds—combine seamlessly to create the otherworldly dreamscape that is Vanishing Place. At the end of McGregor’s presentation, he said, “Our Altered States Biennale Danza invites you to change your internal chemistry, to shift your states of being through experiencing dance, dancers, choreographers, composers and artists work designed to take you somewhere else, somewhere new, somewhere deeper.” Without a doubt, both BOGOTÁ and Vanishing Place do just that. One is intense and gritty, the other slow and surreal, but they are both unforgettable. “And if nothing else,” he continued, “let the exceptional dance transport us beyond words, outside of our rational and more towards this felt-sense—our very own Altered States.” When the Biennale Danza officially announced the winners of the calls for new choreographic works, Peña and Cenere immediately reached out to congratulate each other, floored by the lucky coincidence. Look at that, they wrote to each other from across worlds. See you soon.",

      "text": "Kaiser Kuo: Welcome to the Sinica Podcast, a weekly discussion of current affairs in China, produced in partnership with The China Project. Subscribe to Access from The China Project to get access — access to not only our great newsletter, the daily Dispatch, but to all of the original writing on our website at thechinaproject.com. We’ve got reported stories, essays and editorials, great explainers, regular columns, and, of course, a growing library of podcasts. We cover everything from China’s fraught foreign relations to its ingenious entrepreneurs, from the ongoing repression of Uyghurs and other Muslim peoples in China’s Xinjiang region to Beijing’s ambitious plans to shift the Chinese economy onto a post-carbon footing. It’s a feast of business, political, and cultural news about a nation that is reshaping the world. We cover China with neither fear nor favor. I’m Kaiser Kuo, coming to you from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. ____________________ What would happen if China launched a full-scale amphibious assault against Taiwan? This is a question that has preoccupied American war planners, and presumably their counterparts in Beijing and Taipei and Tokyo, and in other capitals, really since the KMT’s retrenchment on the island in 1949. The question has, of course, gained new currency in recent years, whether you think the likelihood of such a scenario has markedly increased or not. So now, how do war planners answer or attempt to answer that question? Well, by staging wargaming exercises. Today, we are going to look at one such exercise, one that stands out, because unlike the vast majority, which are conducted by war colleges or in Annapolis or within the Pentagon, and are classified, for the most part, this one is, in its methods, its assumption, its execution, and its results, public. They were all made public, and I think that’s to its great credit. Titled The First Battle of the Next War: Wargaming a Chinese Invasion of Taiwan, it took place in 2022 and was published in January 2023. The wargame was conducted under the auspices of CSIS, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and was put together by Mark F. Cancian, his son, Matthew Cancian, and Eric Heginbotham. The latter two were the designers of the wargames. It assumed an amphibious assault, and in the base scenario, direct American military participation in defense of Taiwan. We’ll talk about other assumptions of the game as well. It ran through two dozen iterations with different tweaks to variables. As we’ll see, it’s quite extensive in its scope and a very interesting thing. Now, there are folks I really respect who tend to be dismissive of such exercises. One very good friend has spoken of grown-ass men going pew, pew, pew with little ships and rolling dice like in Dungeons and Dragons. I confess, I’ve leaned that way. I may still lean that way. But whether you see wargames as basically only a little bit above the level of Milton Bradley — “aww, you sunk my battleship!” — or you see them as really valid, valuable, and instructive approximations of likely outcomes, we need to look at what they’re all about, and most importantly, what they purport to tell us. With me to talk about all the pros and cons of wargames, and this one in particular, is Lyle Goldstein, Director for Asia Engagement at Defense Priorities, and a visiting professor at Brown University. Lyle has been on the program twice before once to talk about his really excellent book Meeting China Halfway which I really wish more people in Washington had read and internalized back when it was published, and more recently to talk about North Korea. Lyle was formerly a professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. Lyle Goldstein, welcome back to Sinica. Great to see you. Lyle Goldstein: Hi there, Kaiser. Hi, everyone. So glad to be back on. Kaiser: I’m glad you could make the time to join us. Lyle, you have told me that in your many years, I think it’s two decades at the Naval War College, you didn’t actually participate much in either planning or gaming out the many wargames that are staged there. They’re classified anyway so I wouldn’t ask you to say anything specific about those games, but maybe you could give the listeners a sense for just how important they are at the War College or in other institutes affiliated with the DoD. Perhaps you could talk a little bit about the history of wargaming. I mean, I know for instance, that War Plan Orange, which was the U.S. plan for a war against the Japanese Empire, developed long before Pearl Harbor, actually seems to have grown out of wargaming exercises like these, no? Lyle: That’s right, Kaiser. I want to say upfront, I was not in the wargaming department, and honestly, I tried to stay out of those games. I was more or less a scholar, a China expert there, leading the China Institute for a while, and really trying to organize our China research. Occasionally, some wargamers would come and ask me questions, things like that, and I would give lectures occasionally to them over the years. But I would state that within how the Pentagon planning process works and the Navy planning process, I think wargames are incredibly important. Going around from my 20 years at Naval War College, I can say that the gaming effort there is not only, you know massive, but it is also treated as sort of the crown jewels of the institution. I think that goes well beyond Naval War College to the other places where this is done. Part of that is the storied history of War Plan Orange, which is a fascinating story, probably with some lessons for us today. But the United States started wargaming against Japan in 1919 if you can believe it. We were allies with Japan in World War I, and then right turned around and started preparing for war. So, I guess that tells you how things work, what’s changed. Anyway, by 1924, this was described as War Plan Orange, and took on a more official status. But the interesting thing I learned about it is that in the 1930s, the plans were majorly readjusted to take account of the fact that Japan’s Navy was really increasing at a very rapid pace. This had some major effects on U.S. planning. Originally, I think the plan was to send the fleet over, save the Philippines and give Japan a mighty bruising in the very early stage of the war, but that was all carefully examined, decided not to be realistic, and came up with a much more realistic policy, which we pursued successfully in the war, which was this kind of rather cautious island-hopping strategy, which did not try to get out ahead of ourselves. So, it was quite successful. But I dare say that there are some similarities in that caution that the war planning process imbued our decision makers. I think it’s highly applicable today. We’ll get to that. Kaiser: Yeah. Absolutely, we will. So, let’s talk more specifically. I mean, we could go on a lot about history. I think that’s fascinating and I’d love to read up more about that. But given your knowledge of wargames, even though you were distant from them at the Naval War College, is your sense that this one differed significantly from the others you’ve seen run? After all, those are all classified. We don’t know the details of how they’re run. I don’t really know whether the Cancians or Mr. Heginbotham had direct exposure to DoD or any of the war college games themselves. But were they significantly different? Lyle: Not to my knowledge. One can imagine in classified games, there’s more fidelity, more access to higher classifications of intelligence, things like that. But no, as I understand it, the approach is pretty similar. And now, there’s this quite revealing passage in this, first, I’ll call it the first battle report from the CSIS game where they talk about these classified games, and they say, interestingly, that some of this has leaked out into the press. Traditionally, the results have been very high losses and very pessimistic outcomes. That’s what they say. And then they’re quite dismissive, I think, of that, for whatever that’s worth. There was quite a famous random analyst, I believe he was an Assistant Secretary of Defense, David Ochmanek, I believe. He had said something to the effect of we do this over and over, and the U.S. keeps getting its ass handed to it by the Chinese, which I remember when I first read that, I sort of thought, wow, this is interesting that this is coming into the public realm, to say the least. But again, we don’t know what’s in those games, and we don’t really know, with any fidelity, the results. That’s all behind the black curtain as it were. Kaiser: Lyle, you’ve said that these are incredibly important to the Naval War College and to the DoD. I know it’s a really broad question, but what is the value of wargaming? Lyle: Well, I do think it’s extremely valuable. Somebody I admire very much once said that you can’t prevent a tragedy unless you can envision it. Why? Because to prevent it, we have to fully understand the tragedy, if you will. It’s an uncomfortable topic. The idea that we can sit around a table and talk about tens of thousands of people getting killed. I mean, in a way, it’s an awful endeavor to undertake. But to my estimate, even though it’s rather a dark subject, it’s critically important because it allows us to see that tragedy, and therefore to think really hard about how it can be prevented. I would say, of course, that U.S. national security policy and defense policy has a lot of problems. And one of them has been a kind of failure to anticipate certain issues. Whether it’s the Pentagon Papers or the Afghanistan papers, we’ve seen this again and again, so it’s a related problem, but can we use all the tools at our disposal to look through the crystal ball and see what might happen? I think this has to be done with a lot of modesty, right? Warfare is inherently complex, fog, friction, there are so many unknowns. I mean, the number of factors in play, I don’t think we could ever develop a good algorithm. Some would argue that even the attempt here is kind of, how to put it, it’s immodest. It suggests we could predict. I do think that maybe one of the cautions coming out of this is just that we need a very high level of modesty here. Kaiser: I completely agree. This isn’t the first Taiwan invasion scenario wargame that has been held, just the first large-scale publicly available one I believe. How significant is it that this has been released publicly? Lyle: I think it’s incredibly significant. I track the whole literature across the board on China-military scenarios, but the Taiwan scenario is sort of the scenario par excellence, that is, it is clearly the most dangerous one I would say in all respects. Following the literature, I can say I’ve seen some attempts to get this close, but I’ve never seen this kind of fidelity. I do want to strongly commend it to people and congratulate the authors on their extraordinary work here. That’s one reason I wanted to bring this to the attention of Sinica listeners, yourself included obviously. The idea was to start a debate. But of course, that debate hinges on people reading it closely and not just reading the takeaways or something like that, but really getting into the fine print. I think that’s absolutely necessary. Again, kudos to the authors for putting it out there. Obviously, it was done with all unclassified sources, which is not easy. By doing so, I think they have taken our understanding several levels further. So I really urge all people interested in U.S.-China relations, and in particular in the defense aspects, which, obviously, there’s so much more to the U.S.-China relations. I’m a good Sinica listener, so I know that, and I’m so glad that Sinica is here to remind us frequently that let’s focus on so many other important areas of this relationship. But this one is absolutely very important as you know, Kaiser, and thanks for making time for it, but I really urge people to look at it. Set some time aside, read it carefully. This is so important to the future of our planet. Kaiser: We will obviously have a link to the report, and although I’m not acquainted with its authors, if they happen to be listening or if they catch wind of this, I would love to speak to one or all of them after this show. Lyle: I would be listening closely to that, for sure. Kaiser: Let’s talk a little bit about how wargames like this one are actually set up. Can you describe the physical setup, the game board as it were, and the markers, the dice, and the role of computers in generating contingency and things like that? I’m really curious about what this looks like physically. Lyle: I hesitate here to make too many comments because I don’t think this was discussed very much in the report that’s available. There were a couple of pictures of maybe the game board and some of the parameters. You have to understand that any, I don’t want to speak for the authors, but I think they would readily admit that any game of this kind is, by definition, a vast simplification of numerous human interactions between humans and machines and technology. Therefore, within the game, you make these difficult calls about this level of simplification. And that has to do with how big the hex is. If anybody has played wargames out there, you know that the actual size and lay down of the parameters of the spaces on the map, that influences deeply how the pieces are able to move around the board and so forth. I think there’s some of that. I imagine a lot of that is done by computers, certainly at Naval War College it was, but these aggregations of force, in a way I think that is, and the authors themselves, I think, say in the report that that’s, in a way, the hardest. For example, how can you account for morale? So many intangibles. But also they say quite clearly, and here I think is one of the main points of this whole exercise that is we have never seen, other than what we’re seeing in Ukraine, we have never seen high-intensity warfare, certainly not in the naval and air realm, of the kind that would occur in such a Taiwan scenario — never seen that. Perhaps the last time we did see it, frankly, was 1945. That’s an awful long time ago. Another mentor of mine used to say, military operations, as we conceive of them, are like asking a surgeon to operate every 40 years or so. Kaiser: Wow. Lyle: Can you imagine? Think about that. Surgeons are trained day to day, and they have the most up-to-date techniques and technologies and practices. But on the military side, the amount of data you have, what are we talking about? We’re talking about learning from the Falklands War? Yeah, you bet. There’s a huge amount of Chinese literature, by the way, Chinese military literature study of the Falklands War. Why? Because that is the last high-intensity air enabled combat that the world has seen. Kaiser: I also think about the role of contingency. You mentioned morale and the other intangibles, but even something as simple as weather, I mean, in history, we can think of a couple of great examples. The two, in fact, Mongol invasions of Japan that were scuttled, that were completely ruined because of weather, the Kamikaze, right? The divine wind. Then, of course, the Spanish Armada in 1588, also, just because of weather, it was completely wrecked. Is this something you can just roll dice for, or is this maybe so understood now? Have our forecasting capabilities reached a point where weather just can be assumed away as a variable? Lyle: No, I think you raise a good point. Weather, geography, certainly these play a huge role. But it’s also true to say that progress of information science, intelligence gathering, I mean, often we use D-Day as an analogy, and I think quite appropriate, and the authors of this study do frequently allude to the Normandy invasion from 1944, the allied invasion at Normandy. But then think about General Eisenhower, he didn’t have any helicopters. He didn’t have any drones. He didn’t have any overhead satellite intelligence to look at. Just the information environment has changed to an incredible degree. So, while we should absolutely draw on these analogies, try to understand them, that’s one of the difficulties. And again, lots of credit to the authors. They do quite a good job at drawing historical examples. But I do have some differences in where they made some judgments, as we’ll talk about, I think. Kaiser: Yeah, we will. Lyle: And by the way, China has quite a vastly improved weather forecasting effort. A lot of it is directed at these massive hurricanes that hit China occasionally, but a lot of it is also dedicated to military applications. Kaiser: What sorts of assumptions are built into an exercise like this? One would think that you’d have to have a very good idea of each participant’s, not just their capabilities, but also their own orders of battle, right? What they plan to do. I don’t know how well we know China’s or even some of our allies’ orders of battle, and we don’t know what their warfighting assumptions are. Even the basic scenario here, which posits a massive amphibious assault, is that what China would do necessarily? There are all sorts of people who talk about blockades or other things that are short of full amphibious assault. So I don’t know how much we know this with confidence, and I don’t know how one decides what variables to plug in or what assumptions to plug in. Lyle: Well, you’re right. That’s why this is so vitally important. But it’s important that we read it critically and that we bring fresh eyes, fresh ideas to this, people of all different backgrounds. There are just too many variables. I think the authors, the report would readily concede that they had to pick and choose and make some judgments. They’re bringing a lot of subject matter experts, of course, and many of them are named in the report and very qualified. But I think that people have differences about how they see this. Now, a couple of fine points there. You alluded to the orders of battle. That is really important. One point of caution that I would say is, look, we have a pretty good understanding of what American forces look like, but even there, I think there’s probably a lot of things that are held, capabilities that are not discussed. Kaiser: Sure. Lyle: Let’s put it that way, for sure. Kaiser: Hope so. Lyle: Right. Hope so. On the other hand, I’m quite confident on the Chinese side, there are a lot of capabilities that aren’t discussed. So, we’re operating almost in this fog, and we’re doing the best we can. Traditionally, people draw on the IISS annual reports on the military balance as a kind of, well, we can all agree this is pretty decent as far as the set of orders of battle. I’m pretty sure that’s where the authors took the orders of battle. But I have long been concerned that we put too much stock in this that we are overconfident. After all, China is an enormous country, not a lot of transparency there, a lot of warehouses, a lot of underground facilities. I frequently reminded people that we may think this is what China’s military looks like, but we may not truly know. You raise the issue of how the scenario might look very different. I would just make the quick comment that among people who focus on this day-to-day, we tend to think of at least possible options. There is a kind of political pressure campaign, essentially intimidation. China is already in that. Honestly, if we look at earlier in April, there was that giant exercise, and then back in August 2022, during the Pelosi visit, they were shooting missiles over the island and going over the median line and so forth, although that’s continued. So, you could say that’s already going on. Kaiser: Stepped up from that, though, obviously. Lyle: Two other steps up from there, of course, are the blockade, which is much discussed, and rightly so. And then the authors of this report sort of lay that aside, say that’s a good topic. It may be more likely than this, but that’s not what we’re looking at. And I can tell you why, in a way, we should also look at this amphibious invasion, not just blockade. But then there’s one interim step there too, which I would call limited attack. That would be a Chinese assault, let’s say, on, well, it could be on the offshore islands, although I kind of doubt that. I do think an attack on the Penghus is possible the way that was in the 17th century. That’s how the Chinese conquered Taiwan through the Penghus. And Penghus are just 25 miles off the western coast. So that would be a huge blow. I think the minuses outweigh the pluses if I’m trying to step into the shoes of a Chinese strategist. But it is an important scenario to consider. And then, of course, the scenario that we’re talking about today generally is this all out amphibious assault. Kaiser: Each team presumably has humans playing the roles, right? We’re all familiar or at least sort of familiar with the outlines of Red Team-Blue Team exercises that we had running all through the Cold War. But how much ability do the players have to actually deviate from what they understand are the country that it’s playing and its war fighting plans? In other words, how much agency do the players have? Lyle: It’s a little bit hard to tell. From my little exposure to these kinds of games, I would say that they, frequently, it’s said, don’t fight the game, really try to play within the rules because there’s always that tension, right? What the wargamers are looking for is to yield these creative insights that either red or blue could play, or green. So, there is that possibility. Again, I give a lot of credit to the organizers of this game and the writers of the report that they have tried to allow you almost to sit there with the gamers and kind of appreciate some of their problems. Occasionally, throughout the report, they’ll say, “Well, some players tried to do this.” And they’ll say, “Well, most of our players playing the Chinese side opted to invade from the south.” They say that. That’s very interesting. I wouldn’t have known that. I thought this was a fascinating insight, and again, I think they’re quite candid about the results of the report, good on them for that, they say, “Well, look, they have assumed a nuclear decision-making.” I think we’ll talk about this a bit. They’d assume nuclear decision-making out. There are no nuclear decisions, nuclear weapons decisions in the game. And yet they said they still found that players tended to be concerned with escalation and to behave accordingly, which is very interesting. Even though they were explicitly told there’s no use of nuclear weapons or decisions about nuclear weapons in this game, they still almost behaved as if they still existed. A lot of candor in the report. That’s an interesting insight. Kaiser: Last question before we get to the sort of meat of our conversation in which I will really ask you to talk about the pros and the cons, your critiques as well as the praise you have, last question, how are the political decisions of other countries, South Korea, especially Japan, Australia, how are they factored in? Lyle: I was just studying that part of the report, and it’s particularly fascinating. As far as I can tell, they didn’t try to model all of those. It seemed like they focused on Japan, which is natural to focus on. And one of the, I would say the top four conclusions of their report, is just the all-importance of Japan and in their view Japan’s decisions on this sort of determine the war either way. I have my own thoughts on that. Kaiser: So, iterations that didn’t include Japanese participation on Taiwan’s side ended in defeat or ended in what? Less optimal outcomes for the blue team, right? Lyle: I think they looked at several iterations of Japan’s role. One was total neutrality, presumably that takes off the table. American use of Japanese bases. They basically say that’s the end of that. There would be no U.S. intervention in that circumstance. Then they say it’s also possible that Japan will sort of say, “Yes, you can use the bases,” but Japan’s forces will not be active. Then there are gradations of how active Japan’s forces are going up to fully engaged. What’s interesting here is when they talk about South Korea, Philippines, Vietnam, some of these other countries, and I think they were justifiably cautious, basically saying that their expectation is that South Korea would be neutral. Kaiser: Sure. Lyle: The Philippines as well, which is an interesting conclusion. Some may disagree with that, but I, myself, think that’s quite realistic. Kaiser: I want to spend the rest of our time today just looking at the actual wargame, the CSIS wargame. I know you have quite a number of critiques, but you also have many good things to say about it. You’ve said some very favorable things. I want to just start there. What did you find that you liked that was admirable about this exercise? Lyle: Well, there are several things that I really liked about it. Again, I’m very glad that this report came out and I just can’t say strongly enough how much I recommend it to colleagues that they not just read the text, but that they read the footnotes, and really go through it carefully. Why? Because it is the best fidelity look. It’s the most detailed and thoughtful approach and really tries to look through different options in a reasonably objective way, I’ll say that. Some other things that I really liked about the report is that it’s very candid about the results. I think some of the reporting was pretty accurate, the reports that came out of the press that said, “Wow, the losses potentially here are huge.” We’re talking potentially tens of thousands of Americans, hundreds of U.S. aircraft could be lost, dozens of ships, and even more possibly, we’ll talk about that, some of their very dark scenarios. Kaiser: Well, I think the entire Air Force and Navy of Taiwan are lost in the way it’s played. Lyle: That’s right. That right there I think is meant as a message to Taipei. I mean, frankly, quite accurate. From my assessment too. When I saw that, I was surprised because that’s often, let’s say American strategists think that. They may not say that. They’re too polite, and in this case, I think they were right to put the truth before being diplomatic. Why do they do that? Because a lot of people are concerned that Taiwan is spending a lot of money on its Air Force and Navy, especially over the last 10 years, I think they’ve just launched a new ship, and an oiler. Before that, they launched a major amphibious ship. Got to say that these naval ships are completely worthless in the scenario that we’re envisaging here. The candor there is very welcome. They criticize some U.S. programs as well. I will say that again, rather brave, in the Washington milieu today. Kaiser: It’s not what the Pentagon wants to hear. Lyle: Right. For example, I think the Air Force will be a little…. I mean, they’ll be happy because the report really seems to put a high value on bombers. But by contrast, they seem to see fighters as not particularly useful, which the Air Force, generally, is run by fighter pilots. By the way, the Navy is often also run by fighter pilots. That’s not going to be a very welcome conclusion. They also are rather tough on the Army and the Marines which have both put forward this concept of using basically HIMARS, which has become famous in Ukraine. By the way, Asia Pacific security experts knew about HIMARS before it went to Ukraine, because for more than a decade, we’ve been talking about how this weapon system might be put on the islands and used to constrain the Chinese Navy. But I’ll tell you that this report is quite dismissive of those capabilities, saying, actually, it doesn’t really make a difference. Once the initial set of missiles have been shot off, how are you going to keep these little island strongholds supplied? So, they’re rather dismissive of that capability. They don’t think it’s a very important aspect of the campaign. Kaiser: That falls under the whole, “this is not Ukraine” kind of. Lyle: That’s another. Again, one of the top results that the report underlines in the introduction and conclusion is that we really need to think differently here. This is not Ukraine, and therefore the idea that you’re going to continue to push in supplies at a high level and continuously supply the island, that’s completely off the table. They’re very clear about that. They’re also extremely clear about very heavy U.S. losses, especially to surface ships. Here, they do not mince words. They say, if you look, especially the fine print there, the losses are massive. They say in most scenarios, I believe they said within the first couple of turns, the U.S. has lost two aircraft carriers. Kaiser: Oh, Lord. Lyle: A couple of dozen surface ships. Those are devastating losses. I taught at a Naval War College for years. Many of my students would be on those ships. It’s almost unimaginable. Those are World War II type losses. By the way, many people, including myself, have said that submarines are the key to the whole campaign. They’re more cautious. They say that submarines actually, while important, are not decisive, because they have a small magazine, a magazine is how many munitions you can carry aboard, and the truth is submarines have very limited magazines. Therefore, their firepower is inherently limited. But yeah, I have a lot of good things to say about this study. I have a lot of critiques as well, but I congratulate the authors on their incredible work. Kaiser: I think a couple of other things that I would note that are important is they do call this the first battle. This isn’t how the entire thing plays out, right? They’re very clear about that, that this is just the first encounter. A turn, you alluded to us losing two aircraft carriers in the first turn, our first two turns. A turn is only, what? 36 hours in this game, I believe. So, 72 hours, it’s just… Lyle: Yeah. I mean, it’s devastating. These are devastating losses. Kaiser: One of the other assumptions, you mentioned this, and I think it is good that they built this. It would’ve been unmanageable to do otherwise, perhaps, but I know this may be part of your critique as well, the whole nuclear question. Maybe we can get to that, but just in the plus column, I would note that they do assume that any strike on the mainland elevates the risk of nuclear escalation unacceptably, right? There are no strikes on the Chinese mainland in this scenario. Lyle: Well, I don’t know if I’d be that emphatic. Throughout, the authors are saying they believe that the best approach to the United States is to go into planning more or less with the idea that they will not conduct strikes and generally will not overfly the mainland either. They talk about escalation and they talk about how players were concerned with that. But there are also several parts of the report where they say, “Well, actually, we may have to, as it were, overrule that, or certainly there’ll be a temptation to do that.” I can give you some examples, but I think, generally, they’re very candid about this, about how they’ve taken nuclear decision-making off the table. And that’s good to be honest about that. I certainly understand it, but I must say I’m a little disturbed, though, if we get in the mode where we consider it likely that, for one, that there could be a war with China and nuclear weapons wouldn’t be used, but maybe not. Again, the authors are quite candid about this, and I think in the last couple of pages of the report, they say, “Nobody knows what would happen.” And that’s right. I’m afraid it could be substantially worse even. If you read the pages of International Security and whatnot, a lot of articles recently about inadvertent escalation to nuclear war, that means nobody intends for there to be use of nuclear weapons, but somehow it just happens because some radars are knocked out or satellites are knocked out, and that just gets the ball rolling. But that’s not how I see it. I think you could have advertent escalation that either side is losing and opts to use a nuclear warning shot or limited use to convey that the war needs to end, if you will, escalate to de-escalate that approach. I heard a lot about that in Ukraine. I’m just concerned by the whole idea that we can assume nuclear weapons out. I certainly understand why it has to be done at some level, and you have to try to understand what war looks like without, but then we just don’t know if nuclear weapons would be used or not. And by the way, China is building up its nuclear forces in a very robust way. I put it to a very senior strategist in Shanghai when I was in China back in April, I said, “Why is China building up its nuclear weapons so rapidly?” He looked at me and said, “We’re preparing for the worst-case scenario in Taiwan.” Kaiser: Wow. Lyle: That, to me, really hit hard. I mean, and I have not heard Chinese strategy, that wasn’t the only time I heard something like that when I was in China. I saw a lot of, as it were, flashing signals there. This is very disturbing, and we ought to keep this in the forefront of our mind. I understand why it was done, but I also feel that we absolutely in every circumstance have to remind ourselves. By the way, when this was rolled out on January 9th, it’s a recorded video, I think you can find it on YouTube when this report was rolled out, you could see some disagreement actually among the experts gathered there about the nuclear risks. One of the presenters there, a former general, said, “Well, we just have to call their bluff and not worry about it. And if we have to attack the mainland, so be it.” While other presenters were much more cautious, and I would be on the cautious side there. I think nuclear escalation is so dangerous that we had better play cautious. I also want to say, with respect to your point on the first battle title, it is a striking title. It is an important title. I think a lot of people, including myself, sort of went into the report without reflecting too much on the title, but here’s my problem with it. At the same time as calling this the first battle, we call it a wargame. Throughout the report, it is referred to as a wargame. Shouldn’t it be called a battle game? We kind of lose sight of that. I’m just saying, psychologically, reading through this whole thing, we treat it as if we’re talking about the war. We’re not talking about the war. If it was a true wargame, it would model the war to its conclusion. It doesn’t. There’s no theory of termination. A very fine experienced specialist, Lonnie Henley, stood up at that January 9th gathering, and you can see that on YouTube, and said, “Hey, how does this war end? Because you just said how this China’s amphibious invasion is maybe defeated, but you didn’t explain how the war ends.” I think this is a huge problem. What I’m saying is that the costs of this war could be many times greater than what is discussed in the report. In effect, we should, I guess not to nitpick, but we might call this instead of a wargame. It’s a battle game. Kaiser: Fair enough. I think the fact that they do bring up, though, they remind us periodically through the report that this is about the first battle and that it is not about the war. I mean, I’m not sure what else, what more they could have done to reinforce that point, but I take your point. Lyle: Well, hold on. You do occasionally see this kind of odd reference. We can talk about what they call sort of the most pessimistic scenario, which they hit somewhere on sort of page 99. So, you have to read well into the report. But in that very dark scenario, at one point they basically say the U.S. losses are huge. And then they say the game was called, but what does that mean? Game was called? I guess it means everybody was tired and depressed. That’s what I’m saying. Kaiser: Game over, man Lyle: I guess if you iterate this 24 times, you can’t possibly, and I think somewhere it says in the report that you could have thousands, even millions of variations if you continue to, and they have to make this realistic. But still, you have to keep in mind that a war could be a decade of war. It could be maybe the first war. There could be another war or third war. When we talk about superpowers going to war, as we are here, we better keep that in mind. Kaiser: At the risk of getting a little bit too much into some of the military nitty-gritty, I do want to ask you about your take on the amphibious assault in general. I think you have a pretty different set of conclusions or assumptions than the authors did. Can you unpack that a little bit? Lyle: In general, I’m afraid some of their assumptions could be questionable here. I do feel strongly that they underestimate the number of U.S. Navy ships that might be sunk, unfortunately. But you can look at some of their numbers when they talk about the success of anti-ship missiles, and I see things like they’re crediting the Chinese with something like a 3% hit rate — 3%. Well, to me, that would be wildly optimistic. But let me return to this issue of amphibious. What does the Chinese amphibious fleet look like? And why do I think there’s a problem here in the report? Here, they’re very crisp about this. They say, look, the Chinese have about 96 large amphibious ships of various kinds. Those are the main ships of concern. By the way, they include in that RoRo ferries. Kaiser: Just a quick note, RoRo means roll on, roll off. Lyle: But they say it comes down to this number 96 and say, if they sink, some good portion of those 60 or 80 of those ships that’s feasible for U.S. forces and that’s the whole invasion. I disagree. I think a lot of Chinese soldiers will get to Taiwan by parachute or by helicopter, and they’re very dismissive of that possibility. But the larger problem is this, Kaiser, China has a massive merchant fleet, a massive coast guard, a massive fishing fleet, and there’s good evidence that all of this will be very strongly engaged in this endeavor. By the way, check out a report by Lonnie Henley. I’ve recommended him before, but he has a report at Naval War College published by Naval War College in May 2022, where he says, this effort to use the merchant fleet, civilian shipping is the backbone of the invasion. His evidence is very good. He says, it’s not a stopgap. This is not like just trying to fill a hole here, but this is rather their preferred approach. I agree with that. Of course, it’s somewhat deceptive, right? Here, I’m talking about thousands of ships out there. That changes the whole equation. There’s not 96 ships you have to hit. There are thousands. Kaiser: Reverse Dunkirk. Lyle: That invalidates this. I think there could be 5,000, there could be even 10,000 ships in a variety of different armadas. There’s just no way you can do targeting for that problem. And they’re willing to take huge casualties. Now, the authors kind of dismissed that possibility by saying actually that this was tried at Gallipoli. Folks, do you know about Gallipoli? This happened a long time ago. They were using rowboats back then. I don’t believe that’s a good use of history there. I think that’s a mistake, a major mistake in the report. We have to conceptualize that this, the armada that China would invade with, is much, much larger. Kaiser: You also take issue with the emphasis they place on bombers, on long-range bombers as sort of the main weapon in the American air arsenal. What’s your problem with that claim? Lyle: My analysis generally has tended to focus on submarines. Here, I quite agree with the reports, conclusions on submarines. They say that submarines cannot be decisive here because of, like we talked about, those small magazines. There are other problems with submarines too. Mines we’ve talked about and other, and the reload of the submarine is very difficult as well. The numbers are not adequate. But for bombers, somehow the authors really alight on bombers as the key capability. I don’t see that. The U.S. bomber force is, first of all, not very large. There are many other problems with this as well. The bombers have to get reasonably close to launch these munitions. And China’s fighters have a lot of endurance. They have a large combat radius. They can get out pretty far. So this will be, I would say, a hot environment for our fighters. And they will definitely go after the tankers, right? Our bombers can only operate if they’re supported by tankers. The Chinese know that. They will go right after targeting those tankers, and they will target them at a distance. The gamers, in this report, they’re quite dismissive of China’s ability to reach out. I could easily see a submarine getting off of Alaska and hitting our major air force base in Alaska, for example. But the same thing could happen in Hawaii and Guam, of course, will be targeted. Kaiser: Well, that’s an attack on the mainland, though. Lyle: Yes, I mean, this is something I think is quite possible. Because they know that they would have to target these bombers, I think they could do so rather successfully. Now, those bombers, you have to think about the munitions they’re shooting. And here, the authors are quite specific, they admit that the number of munitions right now that they expect in 2026 is something around 400, or 50, I believe, of these specialized munitions. By the way, these munitions, they’re called LRASM, are not very long-range anti-ship missiles. These missiles are subsonic. Subsonic missiles can be targeted. They’re coming down rather predictable vectors. The Chinese know that. Chinese have exercised very frequently with like-point defense, basically putting as much metal into the sky as you can and downing some of those. I don’t think there will be a high effectiveness for these munitions. I think there are plenty of countermeasures, and China will go all out getting its fighter force out there beyond Taiwan to form a shield, which I think will be quite effective. Then there’s the biggest problem, which alludes to the point I just made about the number of targets. If you only have to destroy 90 ships or 80 ships, maybe the bomber force could be decisive, but if the number is more like 800 or 8,000 ships, there’s absolutely no way that this is a drop in the bucket effectively. So I would strongly disagree with the conclusion that the bomber force will be decisive. Kaiser: Lyle, what did you make of their assumptions about the way that decisions or political decisions are made in the allied capitals in the United States in DC and in Tokyo? Lyle: I tended to focus more on things I know a lot about, the systems going at each other. That was kind of where I put my focus. But my thoughts on the decision-making calculus, frankly, I was a little bit disturbed by the tone there. Although I suppose the simulation is quite realistic, when we think about sort of truncated decision-making, meaning, Mr. President, you’ve got to make this decision whether we’re in or not, whether our forces can go right into combat or not, when you make those decisions, they seem to suggest very clearly, as part of their findings, that the U.S. and Taiwan are much better off, and to assure a win, you need those decisions made extremely quickly. To me, it did feel very unrealistic. In fact, I don’t recall any mention in the report of whether the war powers resolution or the constitutional issue of the fact that the Congress… This would be a war, folks. Clearly, the Congress should be involved in my perspective. By the way, that goes for Japan too. At one point, I recall, I went over this the other day, their assessment of Japanese decision-making, they said, “This is fully within the powers of the Prime Minister of Japan to make this decision. So, it all depends on him or her.” Actually, I think that is a vast simplification as I understand Japanese politics, and I believe the courts might play a role in the Japanese case, right? Because there are some complications with the peace constitution. I don’t doubt that the Japanese legislature would also seek to be involved. This is democracy after all. What I’m saying is, while from a war planners or, if you will, from a military point of view, you always want the decision to be made without delay, but yet, I just don’t think that’s how politics work really. Given what we’ve seen on Ukraine where decisions have evolved, let’s say a lot, and they started out very cautious, especially when we’re talking about two nuclear powers potentially going to war, if we took the Ukraine lesson, we have to say that it’s very unlikely that the U.S. and Japan will both jump in with two feet at that immediate moment. Kaiser: Lyle, you also take issue, I believe, with this assumption that we would have at least two weeks of sort of unambiguous warning that this was coming. I know you’ve probably read John Culver’s report in the Carnegie Endowment for National Peace, but you think that there wouldn’t necessarily be anything like that kind of a long warning. Can you break that out a little bit for us? Lyle: I noticed Culver’s essays cited in the CSIS report, and I think most people agree with Culver as it was a well-received piece. I don’t. I take issue with it. I have a lot of respect for him. But here, I think he’s quite off the mark. He argued that we would have months of warning. Now in the report they say, well, the Chinese might be able to orchestrate something more devious or, if you will, more deceptive. So not months, but they think days, 14 days at least. They really think 30 days. And they say 14 days of unambiguous warning. In my view, I think we can expect just a few hours, and maybe not at all. That’s my view. I’m happy to give you my where that assessment comes from. But just in a nutshell, I would say, look, we have a whole history of Chinese pattern of this where they have been very successful at deception. Sun Tzu said all warfare is deception. Look at Korea, we were completely surprised when they entered the war against India. They were also completely surprised. Kaiser: But we didn’t have satellites back then, we didn’t have nearly the kind of, even the OSINT that we have now. Lyle: We had a lot of capability, though. We really owned the air and we had people on the ground in Korea and all that. I don’t think that’s such a good excuse. On the other hand, I think China also has a vast apparatus for creating deception. I spent a lot of time in Chinese ports like Dalian and Qingdao and so forth, and it’s just incredible, the scope of not only the merchant fleet, the fishing fleet, and all these just vast warehouses everywhere. Let me put it also to you this way that when we’re talking about air and missile forces, these are very quickly deployed, and most of the force is already in place. The same goes for heliborne and airborne forces that again, it’s a matter of hours pushing it forward. Then what I would expect is what I call a rolling start. A rolling start begins with the missile, air drone, heliborne attack. And it’s only then, once that is underway, and there’s substantial fighting on the island, I think tens of thousands of PLA troops on the island brought by parachute or helicopter or special boats, whatever. Only then is the full call up and things begin to go upward ships. If you look at D-Day, 150,000 troops and all their equipment went aboard in just five days. I actually think the Chinese would be much more efficient than they were on D-Day. Why? Because D-Day was put together in about a year and a half. China’s been planning this for decades and has the most advanced ports in the world. I rather suspect that these ships would be loaded very quickly. Another thing, we could talk about this all day, but another aspect of this here, well, I would say they’ve also normalized this pattern of exercises. Actually just today, there was a piece in The New York Times, it’s August 11th, a piece by Chris Buckley that talked about how these exercises have become so common that Taiwan forces have sort of said, “Well, we’re not going to intercept. It’s too expensive to try to intercept all these.” So, it’s become rather normal for a large quantity of Chinese ships and planes to be sort of circling the island at any given time. And of course, that can quickly go into the real thing. One final thing I’ll say here is I’ve looked a lot at how China has actually studied Normandy a lot. And by the way, they studied Inchon, and Inchon is almost more interesting. Their conclusion on Inchon, this was MacArthur’s famous invasion in September 1950, where he really turned the tables with a brilliant operation. But they literally said the reason Inchon succeeded is because nobody thought they could do it there, and that’s why it was successful. So, go with the unexpected. I’m convinced that Chinese strategists fully understand that surprise is the key to the entire operation. They will go all in on surprise. That’s why I almost find it comical when I hear my colleagues saying, “Well, I’m reading the tone of this latest editorial and PLA daily, and it sounds very chill.” Okay? So, I guess they won’t go tomorrow. They’re looking, and they also, there’s an expectation in the game. And here, I don’t agree with this in the CSIS game, they say they expect there will be about a month of crisis or something preceding the attack. I don’t see it that way. I think China is wise to this and knows that to get full surprise, they don’t want to act in the middle of a crisis. They’ll act, essentially, as a bolt from the blue. That’s my expectation. And it’s driven by the military imperative of surprise for amphibious attack. Kaiser: In an interview that Chas Freeman did, I guess it was more than a year ago, we were talking about Admiral Davidson and the suggestion of 2027, and he said the most likely moment for a Chinese surprise attack would be after November 2024. He thinks that it’s when there’s sort of this moment of where we momentarily are kind of incapacitated, we have a presidency in transition or in the immediate aftermath of January 20th or inauguration day. That’s the danger period. Lyle: We can think about a variety of danger periods. By the way, Hawaii is going through a terrible crisis right now, right? A lot of distraction in a major base area, I mean, probably not the actual bases, but I’m just saying one can imagine a Chinese leader saying, well, we got these variety of opportunities, what kind of opportunities they are, ranging from something going on in the Pershing Gulf, let’s say, to some massive storm knocking out power on the east coast of the U.S. One can imagine a variety of issues that might play into this decision. I’ll give you an example here again, I mentioned the Sino-Indian War. There’s a reason why not many American strategists are that familiar with it because it happened during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kaiser: Cuban Missile Crisis, yeah. Lyle: The U.S. was fully distracted during that, and China knew it, and therefore was able to act very robustly and without any concern. Actually, the Indians did a cable from Nehru to Kennedy, “Please send help now.” The phone was not answered at all because Kennedy was very tied up. So, I could imagine. And I do think there’s a danger with Ukraine. If the Ukraine War continues to escalate and so forth, or continues to go in unexpected directions, China could use that. Clearly, they know that a lot of U.S. effort, say intelligence effort, for example, there’s only finite capabilities to watch closely. A lot of that is now directed at Russia, of course. Kaiser: You’re going to find yourself quoted by Bridge Colby in a second. Lyle: I’ve gone around the bend with Bridge. He is very smart, but we disagree on a lot of things. Kaiser: I’ve had some funny encounters with him as well. So, your overall top-level worry then is that without reading the fine print as it were, policymakers or influential media outlets or personalities, or maybe even key people in the national security establishment are going to come away though with too sanguine a view on what the upshot is, what the casualties would be, what the results would be. That this is ultimately doable. Is that fair? Lyle: That is kind of the disturbing feeling I get after reading the report carefully. I feel like the authors have ultimately come down and said, “Look, this would be hard, but if we make a few critical decisions, we don’t need to radically expand the defense budget. We just need to invest in these several capabilities.” Like I said, they favor bombers. They want to see a lot more munitions put on these bombers. I’m quite skeptical of some of their recommendations there. Also, I do think that the estimates there, as far as losses, are far too optimistic favoring the United States. That is, unfortunately, although they’re presented as sort of catastrophic losses, hundreds of aircraft, dozens of ships, I’m afraid it could be considerably worse, Kaiser. That’s my evaluation of their assumptions, looking at some of the numbers that go into their assumptions, and just based on my own research of some of China’s countermeasures. Kaiser: In a nutshell, if you could summon the National Security Advisor, the Joint Chiefs, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the President himself, get them to sit down and you give them your take on what comes out of this wargame, what would you say? You get your chance to rewrite the executive summary. Lyle: Oh, goodness. Well, I think, by all means we should hear what the authors have to say themselves. Again, maybe I’ll refer you to that YouTube presentation they made on January 9th of 2023. My take is that I agree that the war could be devastating, but I think if we take that sober look, which we got from this report, and then inject some additional uncertainty, especially given nuclear risks, but also I would say, have we perhaps underestimated the lethality of some of China’s weapons? I think, unfortunately, that may be the case. Losses could be considerably greater, in my view, than this report says. I think losses could be even double or triple what they project. And I’d like to back that up with some evidence if you’ll permit it. But given all that, I believe that the United States should be extremely circumspect about this, and by the way, the Japanese as well, and should reflect a little less on what magic capability they can produce to solve this problem. Because after all, that’s our go-to idea. This is a tough situation. What technology can we invent to solve it? That’s how Americans do things. But that didn’t work in Vietnam, it didn’t work in Afghanistan, and it’s not going to work here. This is a bridge too far. That’s my view. We should recognize that and take a much more realistic view. That means having a very robust diplomatic track to help Taiwan preserve its autonomy to keep with strategic ambiguity, maintain the One China policy, and really use diplomacy, which we can talk about that. That’s not really discussed in the CSIS report, but it’s critically important to pursue some sort of reassurance on that count. From a defense point of view, I think we can make some prudent investments, draw red lines that are realistic for the back, realize that the Pacific is very big and wide, and that Japan and the Philippines are not under grave threat. Taiwan is under grave threat, but our treaty allies are not, and reconsider and play this very cautiously. Kaiser: Lyle Goldstein, thank you so much for joining me again on Sinica and for sharing your informed views on this wargame and on other subjects. It was just great to have you on again, man. Lyle: Thank you so much, Kaiser. Really glad to join you. Kaiser: Let’s move on now to recommendations. But first, a very quick couple of reminders. First, don’t forget that our next China Conference is in New York on November 2nd, the Midtown East area near the UN, a lovely event space. You can get tickets now. It is going to be a fantastic conference. Great speakers like Yasheng Huang and Evan Feigenbaum, lots of folks from government, from major think tanks, from the media world, from academia, and from industry. It’s going to be quite star-studded. Some very deep, very heady panels that we’ve got planned, deep-dive breakout sessions on super important topics, and even a kind of jeopardy like game show that I will be hosting at the end of the day. I will also be taping a live Sinica episode along with Jeremy on the evening of November 1st in New York, the exact location and guest, TBD. So, sign up for that as well if you can. And if you can’t come to the conference, but you still want to support the work that we’re doing, please take a moment and become an Access member of The China Project. You get our Daily Dispatch newsletter, you get early access to Sinica. and much more, all for the cost, three or four cups of coffee a month. All right, on to recommendations. Lyle Goldstein, what do you have for us? Lyle: Well, thanks, Kaiser. I’m a little reticent here to share my recommendation just because I feel like this has probably been said before. I live in Southern New England here, and I must say the best Chinese museum presentation I’m aware of around here is at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts. They have this incredible exhibit. They took an incredible, well, almost a palace, transported it, the entire thing from Anhui Province, and deposited it inside the museum. It makes a stunning courtyard. If you haven’t seen that, you must see it. Having been to Anhui myself and seeing some of these gorgeous villages, this is a very faithful take on it. It really gives just a wonderful view of Chinese aesthetics and the design and philosophy and history. And of course, all the research surrounding it and how they moved this wonderful piece of architecture over, it’s called Yin Yu Tang. And it’s just stunning. So, please make the time and go see. By the way, I used to parade Naval War College faculty through there so that they would deepen their understanding of how Chinese think about aesthetics and design. Kaiser: Lyle, that has not been recommended on Sinica before, and it’s a fantastic recommendation. There was no reason at all for you to be reticent about it. It’s great, man. I’m anxious. I want to get up there and check that out. Lyle: Salem, Massachusetts. Yeah, outside Boston. You can check out the Witch museum too, there. Kaiser: Yeah, for sure, for sure. All right. I want to recommend something once again. Actually, I’ve recommended I think bits and pieces of this before, I’m not sure I’ve ever recommended the whole thing, but the series, The Story of Civilization by Will Durant with the later volumes, co-written with his wife, Ariel Durant. Growing up, I think every family I knew had a set of these, along with their World Book or Britannicas. I didn’t know many people who actually read them, though. When I was a child, it just never sort of occurred to me, they were so thick and so daunting, and I just never pulled any of them down and really flipped through them. I started doing that in high school. I read The Age of Faith, which is the fourth volume of 11, just because I was… I think I was writing a paper on the Crusades or something, but then I realized it was just so well written and so interesting, so engaging that I devoured the whole thing. I only revisited them maybe a decade or so ago, and then I actually set a goal of reading all of them. And so, I’ve done that. I listened to most of them. I’ve read some of them in print, but most of them were available, more and more of them became available on Audible as audiobooks. They’re just a delight. They’re just so fun to listen to. I mean, long drives or on flights or whatever, walking the dog or cooking or doing the dishes, or all those mundane things that you do where you can have a pair of earphones in. Well, these days, I listen to audiobooks as I practice archery. I try to practice for an hour or so a day, and I listen to them, but they’re just an absolute joy. There’s all sorts of really sly, often pretty risqué humor. He’s just very funny. And just as a pro-stylist, Will Durant was just amazing. I recently finished two, I revisited two, just because I was on this sort of Thirty Years’ War kick I talked about a little bit ago, and I decided to sort of read The Reformation and then The Age of Reason Begins, which covers that. It’s actually in that one that Thirty Years’ War is covered, but all the wars of religion and the reigns of Elizabeth and the early stewards and stuff. It’s great stuff. It’s amazing stuff. Last night, just for the hell of it, I just started listening to Our Oriental Heritage, which is the very first one, which I haven’t gotten back to in a long time. But just the opening essays of that, maybe that’ll be my more focused recommendation, the early chapters of that. There are these real essays on civilization. This was published in 1935, so it reads like it’s dated, and it’s interesting because this is before the second war, but still in the aftermath of the first. There are references to Versailles and things like that. Lots of things that are wrong with audible.com, I know, and I find them problematic as the monopsony that they are. But it just is amazing to me that for one credit, you can actually, 10 bucks or whatever, you can listen to 50-plus hours of this amazing high-quality narration of brilliant historical writing. It’s a miracle. Anyway, that’s my recommendation, Will and Ariel Durant. It just never gets old. I love their stuff so much. Lyle, thank you once again for joining me. Lyle: Thanks, Kaiser. It’s been a real pleasure talking with you. Let’s do it again soon. Kaiser: Absolutely. Yeah, sobering stuff too. But I will put a link to the report, and once again, if Mr. Cancian either feel or pair our listening, or if Mr. Heginbotham wants to get in touch, I would be delighted to talk to you more about this wargame and the report. The Sinica Podcast is powered by The China Project and is a proud part of the Sinica Network. Our show is produced and edited by me, Kaiser Kuo. We would be delighted if you would drop us an email at sinica@thechinaproject.com or just give us a rating and review on Apple Podcasts as this really does help people discover the show.

      "title": "The Media Is Failing In Reporting On Biden&#039;s Economy - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "State-based news the Courier called out the New York Times on Tuesday for their vastly different headlines about the economy under two different presidents. Spot the differences, @NYTimes. pic.twitter.com/m5XQXJs3Xd — COURIER (@CourierNewsroom) August 8, 2023 Is this a fair criticism? It’s not apples to apples, as one is the headline going to their podcast and the others are articles. This might impact the way a headline is written. But in this case, it is a good point to raise and worth getting in to, especially as many people only read headlines and most Americans are not aware of the incredible improvements to the economy under President Biden. The best way to educate them would be to have headlines that say what is happening. Why does this matter? Only 37% approve of Biden’s handling of the economy in spite of the fact that it is performing remarkably well — and so much better than we had any right to hope for. Why don’t people have the information they need to see who is pushing policies that actually help them? Here are the top four Google hits for Biden economy right now (the one blaming Biden for the Fitch downgrade is an unmarked opinion piece only showing in the URL, oddly taking front row status): People only know what the media tells them, as most people don’t have the time to pour over economic data after getting home from a hard day’s work, feeding their kids, cleaning the house and more. That’s why the media is supposed to inform voters so they can vote in their own best interests. The NYT might not cater to those people; it clearly doesn’t, actually. But they do set the tone for all U.S. based media. The differences in Trump versus Biden in terms of headlines (the NYT is hardly alone with this) is even more egregious than it appears on the surface, because President Donald Trump inherited a good economy from President Barack Obama, whereas President Joe Biden not only inherited the economy Trump’s policies damaged before the pandemic, but Biden inherited a pandemic-gutted economy midway through the pandemic. It was a mess. The reality is actually clear Eight days ago, the New York Times wrote, “Inflation is cooling, business investment is rising, job growth is powering on and surveys suggest rising economic optimism among consumers and voters.” The details they cited: “The economy grew at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter of the year, handily beating economists’ expectations, the Commerce Department reported last week. Price growth slowed in June even as consumer spending picked up. The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of year-over-year inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, has now fallen to 3 percent this year from about 7 percent last June — easing the pressure on Mr. Biden from the economic problem that has bedeviled his presidency thus far.” In that same piece, they quote an expert who says “the increased investment was ‘undoubtedly linked’ to government policies, in particular the CHIPS Act, which aimed to promote domestic manufacturing, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which targeted low-emission energy technologies to combat climate change.” So, undoubtedly linked to Joe Biden’s policies. Should he get credit for it? They’re not sure, according to Monday’s headline. But, if you open that piece, they actually have great news: “The latest economic figures are some of the best of President Biden’s tenure so far. It appears increasingly likely that the United States has managed to tame high inflation without causing a recession.” They say they are looking at why this hasn’t translated to a bump in Biden’s poll numbers. Might I suggest that headlines asking a question that suggest Biden might not be responsible for the improvement are not helping? One thing most people in publishing know is that many readers never even open the piece. The headlines inform them. People are busy. Headlines matter. We all get them wrong sometimes. But the media obviously needs to do better than we are right now. The weeds: Trump wrongly claimed that he inherited a “disaster” from Obama and bragged almost every single day about how great things were under him. But actually, Trump took the economy Obama saved from the 2008 crash that occurred under President George W. Bush, and set about undermining it and making it work for the wealthy instead of everyone with trade wars, a tax cut that mostly benefited the wealthy (and would only get worse after he was out of office). Even the chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush agrees. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist, was quoted in the New York Times saying, “I can say that the economy was in fine shape at the end of the Obama administration, despite what President Trump sometimes asserts… The tax cuts likely made it stronger, while worsening the long-term fiscal imbalance. Reasonable economists can and do disagree about how much impact the tax plan has had.” Of course, even in that piece, Peter Barker writes “Mr. Trump has some particularly compelling bragging points, though… Mr. Trump’s supporters argue that he turbocharged them with his tax cuts and deregulation, defying critics’ predictions that he would wreck the economy.” It should be noted this was dated in 2018, shortly before the impact of Trump’s devastating policies chipped away at the economy he inherited. By July of 2019, economic growth had already slowed “as consumer rebound was offset by rising trade gap,” according to Politico. In 2018, the NYT were asking another question in a title: “How Good Is the Trump Economy, Really?” As effusive as that June 2018 piece was about Trump’s economy, the enthusiasm sadly turned out to be misplaced. But when you look at how Neil Irwin closed, his piece tells a different story than the title, “The president inherited an economy that had come a long way toward healing. During his administration, the economy has continued growing at about the same rate it did before he took office, pushing incomes, employment and output to yet higher levels.” Things were pretty bad under Trump Trump also should be held responsible for how his poor leadership impacted the United States’ incompetent response to the pandemic, which contributed to the economic devastation the pandemic wrought. The nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute, which focuses on how the economy is performing for working people, concluded of Trump’s policies, “In fact, Trump administration policies were squandering the pockets of strength in the U.S. economy that they inherited from their predecessors by using them to disguise the rapid erosion their policies were causing to U.S. families’ economic security… This poor income growth during the Trump administration could be a statistical fluke. But it’s also exactly what one would expect from an incompetent economic manager squandering the pockets of strength it inherited from its predecessors.” As for the (disingenuous, given how many times “trickle down” has failed to trickle down) conservative argument that the tax cuts stimulated the economy, “On the supply side, the Trump administration would claim that this same tax cut boosted incentives for firms to invest in the economy’s capital stock. The data show pretty conclusively that this is wrong—business investment was absolutely plummeting well before COVID-19 had even appeared in China, let alone the United States.” Biden Has The Data Biden has claimed the U.S. economy has the strongest post-pandemic growth recovery in the world, and his administration provided the data to back it up. Newsweek determined, “(I)t does look like Biden has good grounds to make the claim he made about the U.S. economic growth performance.” It usually takes a few years for the results of a president’s economic policies to be seen, but in Biden’s case, the results came a little sooner due to how much work he had to do to bail this country out of the disaster it found itself in, like so many other countries. His policies can be compared to other countries’ and they show that the U.S. is recovering at a faster pace. Where are the articles saying Biden has “particularly compelling bragging rights” about this economy? Where are the “Economy Hits a High Note, Biden Takes a Bow” “Biden Has a Strong Economy to Proclaim. In Wisconsin, It Just Might Work.” pieces? Conclusion: The titles seem skewed in terms of where skepticism is placed. The articles themselves are not skewed in the same way. This is yet another argument for good titles, which are the bane of everyone’s existence but that is no reason not to try harder. What really matters is how people are doing The bottom line is that the U.S. economy shouldn’t be measured by how the stock market is doing or bombastic claims by any president. For far too long, the economic well-being of the majority of Americans has been ignored while leaders focus on those who can make big political donations. Joe Biden is focusing on the majority of people. That is why he keeps working on things like the Biden-Harris administration did today, with Vice President Kamala Harris announcing a new rule via the Labor Department that will ensure investments in America lead to “jobs where construction workers are paid fairly, including the 84% of who don’t have a college degree.” What’s the deal The Biden-Harris administration should absolutely get credit for the work they have actually done to prioritize people being supported with well paying jobs and more. What is the deal? Why is it so easy to give a man like Trump credit for something he didn’t actually make on his own, but so hard to give a man like Biden credit for something he has worked his tail off for since taking office? Joe Biden isn’t perfect and neither is the economy. But it’s doing remarkable well. It deserves to be celebrated. Americans need something to feel good about and this is real and it helps them. Our legacy papers could do a better job of informing people and setting the tone in their titles. The content itself, however, is fair in all of these pieces. It’s obvious that the average American is misinformed about the economy. There’s no need to give that misinformation further assist than it is already getting from propaganda outlets on the right.",

      "text": "The Federal Operations Unit, Zone A Ikeja, of the Nigeria Customs Service, said it intercepted a Toyota Sienna vehicle loaded with 15 bulletproof jackets, 15 pieces of jack knives, and 20 pieces of pistol pouches at Ijebu-Ode checkpoint in Ogun State. A statement by the command on Wednesday said the driver of the vehicle was arrested and the controlled wares seized. In the statement, the acting Customs Area Controller in charge of the unit, Hussein Ejibunu, said importation of any form of bulletproof items required an end-user certificate from the office of the National Security Adviser. The statement read, “Within July, our officers intercepted smuggled 15 bulletproof jackets, 15 pieces of jack knives, and 20 pieces of pistol pouches inside a Toyota Sienna bus in Ogun State at Ijebu-Ode Checkpoint. “The driver of the vehicle was arrested with the seized controlled wares. It is pertinent to know that the importation of all forms of bulletproof materials such as vests, ballistic materials, and vehicles, as well as parts and accessories for all military armaments and hardware such as guns, arms, and ammunition of all kinds; lethal and non-lethal requires an end-user certificate.” Ejibunu said a total of 50 seizures were made and 13 persons were arrested in connection with different seizures in July. “Notable among the seizures made were, 5,642 bags of foreign rice 50kg each equivalent to nine trailer loads, 18,925 litres of Premium Motor Spirit, 20 pieces of pistol pouches, 15 pieces of bulletproof jackets, 15 pieces of jack knives, 49 cartons of children school shoes, 181 parcels of Indian Hemp 87 kg each, 357 kegs of vegetable oil five litres each, one unit of Honda Motorcycle, two used (Tokunbo) vehicles, among others,” he said. He also said that the duty-paid value of the seized goods stood at N463m.

      "title": "\"Aaftab Poonawala Chopped Up Body In Toilet\": Shraddha Walkar's Father To Court",
      "text": "Aaftab Amin Poonawala, the man accused of slaying his live-in partner Shraddha Walkar, told the victim's father he chopped her body into pieces in the toilet of their rented home and disposed them of over time in Chattarpur Pahadi. Vikas Madan Walkar, Shraddha's father, testified before a Delhi court that Poonawala, upon reaching the nala (drain) behind the Shamshan Ghat Mandir (Cremation ground temple) on '100 Futa Road' in Chattarpur Enclave, pointed at the exact place where he disposed of the body parts. Delhi police recovered around 13 bones, including the pelvic bone of the deceased, at the place, he said. The Delhi court was recording the testimonies of witnesses in the sensational murder case. Shraddha Walkar, who was in a live-in relationship with the accused, was allegedly strangled by Poonawala on May 18 last year. The accused was alleged to have sawed her lifeless body and kept it in a fridge before disposing of the pieces in desolate places across the city over several days to dodge the police and the public. Many of her body parts were discovered later in a nearby forest. Vikas Madan Walkar, who was examined as a prosecution witness by the public prosecutor before Additional Sessions Judge Manisha Khurana Kakkar, testified that Poonawala strangulated his daughter on May 18, 2022. He then cut her body into small pieces for easy disposal. “Poonawala led the police team to the place where he had killed my daughter (the rented house in Chhatarpur). He pointed out the place where he had killed my daughter and also the place where he had cut my daughter into pieces, which is the toilet/bathroom,” he said. Poonawala then disclosed he had packed the pieces of the body in trash bags and stored them in a refrigerator in the living room. When his “new girlfriend” visited the accused, he would remove the trash bags from the fridge and store them on a wooden shelf in the kitchen, Vikas Walkar said. He said Poonawala also led the police team to a place at the drain behind the the Shamshan Ghat Mandir on '100 Futa Road' in Chhatarpur Enclave. “Upon reaching the place, he pointed out the exact place where he had disposed of the body parts, and on his pointing out, a total of 13 bones, including one pelvic bone were recovered by the police,” he said. During the proceedings on Saturday, which lasted around six hours, the refrigerator, where the body parts had been allegedly kept, and the wooden pieces suspected of having the deceased's blood stains were produced in court. Vikas Walkar identified the pieces of evidence, following which the video and audio clips of Poonawala and Shraddha were also played in the court. After Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad completed the examination-in-chief, Poonawala's counsel started the cross-examination which continued for around two hours. “It is wrong to suggest that I deposed regarding the fight between my daughter and Poonawala based on the information given by my (late) wife. Voluntarily, before the death of my wife, I had called my daughter home and personally inquired about the fact and she confirmed that the accused used to fight with her and beat her,” he said. He claimed Poonawala disclosed about having killed his daughter around 6 pm on May 18. The court has posted the matter for further cross-examination on Monday.

      "title": "Best online baby and children clothing brands 2023",
      "text": "There was once a time when children’s clothes were considered purely functional, with parents given little choice than to dress their kids in dreary finds from a select few shops on the local high street. Luckily, that’s all changed now. Blame it on the competitive parent trap or social media, but children’s clothes have never been so stylish. In fact, some of the pieces are so fashion-forward, you’ll wish they came in adult sizes, too. (Spoiler alert: some do). From cool, neutral shades to rainbow brights, fancy dresses and dungarees that are perfect for explorers of the outdoors, finding clothing that both you and your kids love has never been so easy. But, with such a large variety of stores now at your fingertips, it can be difficult to know which ones are good quality and what pieces are going to last. Not only do kids put their clothes through a lot, they seem to grow from one size to the next in a flash. As such, it’s important to find items that are not only durable and hardwearing but comfortable and, of course, appealing to the eye. Whether you’re shopping for a newborn, toddler or even a tween, we’ve done the hard work for you by rounding up the best baby and children clothing stores for 2023. We’ve made sure to include all types of clothing from both high street and independent brands, and have also picked out our favourite pieces from each one, taking into consideration everything from age range to quality and value for money. If you thought shopping for yourself was a dangerous habit, wait until you scour House of Margaux, where it’s almost impossible not to add everything to your online basket. If we had to pick one piece though, it would be this romper, which is decorated with an all-over “girl power” print. Made from organic cotton, it’s incredibly soft and has a generous amount of stretch, meaning it will last your little one for many months. Put a smile on their face, and yours, with this fun two-piece set that will see them through cosy weekends at home and trips to the park. Made to fit slightly oversized, the top and joggers are made with a soft sweatshirt fabric and brushed inside. We love that the long-sleeved top comes with press-studs on the shoulder, making it easy to dress even the wriggliest of toddlers, while the elasticated drawstring waist give plenty of room for growth. Dungarees are one of the most versatile items you can have in your kid’s wardrobe and this pair has it all. Ideal for creating an all-in-one outfit that requires little-to-no planning, they feel incredibly soft and have a decent amount of stretch, making them comfortable to wear, no matter what your child is getting up to. We love the practical details too, with adjustable straps and turn-ups meaning they’ll last longer and can even be passed down once they eventually grow out of them. A piece they can wear now with sandals and in the winter with tights and boots, this dress is made from a textured woven fabric with long sleeves and a V-shaped bodice at the front. We also like the balloon shaped sleeves that have elasticated cuffs and the pretty frill detail at the waist. Finish the look with the matching headband, which features the same all-over disty floral print with a delicate bow and an easy-to-use velcro fastening. Whether you’re on the hunt for something to keep your little one warm on those not-so-summery days (which, let’s face it, we’re having plenty of) or looking ahead to the cooler months, this cosy cardigan is a must. Made from organic cotton, it’s beautifully soft and we adore the playfully bright take on a traditional Fair Isle print. The sizing is generous too, meaning it will last well into next season and beyond. Plus, it currently has a whopping 40 per cent off. We’re big fans of Polarn O.Pyret, especially this unique top, which has been created in collaboration with Swedish author Astrid Lindgren and illustrator Ilon Wikland. Bringing the duo’s beloved characters to life, the tunic-style top features fun paint pot shaped pockets and is made from soft organic cotton. The elastic cuffs and A-line shape give it a comfortable fit and it washes extremely well. Calling all bleary-eyed parents: this sleepsuit is a gamechanger, especially when it comes to midnight changes. Available in sizes newborn to 18-24 months, this sleepsuit is different to most others as it is designed with a two-way zip at the front so you can undo it from the bottom up, meaning you no longer need to fully undress your baby or take on the impossible task of fastening what feels like 50 buttons in the dark. Plus, it’s seriously soft and washes amazingly. With its playful prints, catchy slogans and bright colours, House of Margaux is sure to make you and your little one smile. With each of its items lovingly handmade by owner Cassie, the brand prides itself on creating clothing for babies and toddlers using organic cotton, bamboo and eco-friendly pigment inks. Spanning everything from tops and leggings to dresses, sleepsuits and rompers, the entire range is unisex with sizes ranging from newborn up to seven-years-old. A gender-neutral clothing brand for little ones aged up to eight years, Turtledove offers timeless designs in a muted colour palette and all of its pieces are made using organic cotton and Azo free dyes. Selling everything from dungarees and leggings to dresses and swimwear, this brand is ideal for lovers of clothes with timeless appeal and a minimalist aesthetic. There’s no need to envy your child’s wardrobe either, as Turtledove London also has a women’s collection complete with tunics, tote bags and T-shirts. Dressing your child head to toe in Kite guarantees they will stand out in the playground. Colourful and fun, the brand’s range is stylish, built to last and planet friendly, offering GOTS certified organic cotton clothing and accessories for babies, toddlers and older children using high quality fabrics and bright modern prints. From one off pieces to mix and match collections spanning knitwear, skirts, sweatshirts and dungarees, there’s something to suit every child aged 0 to 13 years. Plus, there’s a women’s collection too. If it’s high quality, organic and super-fun clothes that you’re after, look no further than Swedish brand Polarn O. Pyret, which has been around for more than 45 years. Bursting with charming designs, the label categorises its clothes by age, not gender, in a bid to encourage little ones to wear whichever designs they love. Made to fit from newborn to age 11, the brand uses eco-friendly materials and is committed to ensuring that its clothes are durable, claiming that each piece is designed to last at least three children. Polarn O. Pyret also promises to fix zips and broken poppers on any of its outerwear garments, no matter when they were bought and has a unique preloved scheme called PO.P Second-hand, where it buys back used clothing. For dungarees that are as cute as they are comfortable to wear, look no further than this British-based brand that was co-founded by two mums. With short and traditional styles on offer, the brand’s dungarees are a wardrobe essential that truly lasts as they’ve been cleverly designed to grow with your child. Each pair features clever details such as adjustable straps, turn ups, while those up to 24 months also come with hidden zip access, making light work of nappy changes. Available in a range of colourful designs, from bright patchwork to love hearts and stripes, the brand’s clothes are also designed to be incredibly soft with cotton jersey linings that won’t irritate sensitive skin. For gender neutral clothing that guarantees your child will be the most fashionable tot in town, head to Claude & Co, where you’ll find a range of baby and toddler pieces made from organic and sustainable materials. Famous for its “Milking It” range, the British brand caters for newborns up to six years and, in addition to its popular ribbed bodysuits, you’ll find everything from overalls and co-ords to jackets and hats in a variety of earthy tones and cool prints. One sure-fire way to get your child excited for bedtime is with a pair of Sleepy Doe’s dreamy pyjamas. Specialising in organic sleepwear for children and women, the brand was founded by Bath-based mum Sophie Woodrow, who lovingly creates every print featured on the pyjama sets. From newborn sleepsuits to classic trouser sets for toddlers and older children up to 11 years, there’s something for everyone, including grown-ups, so make sure to look out for the matching mama and me sets too. A female-owned business with the main aim of empowering women through positive, strong and meaningful merch, Mutha.hood is perhaps best known for its range of women’s T-shirts that carry the slogan “Strong Girls Club”. But the good news is that little ones can get involved too, as there’s an entire kids range of babygro’s, tees and sweatshirts that are all made from organic cotton. Founded by award-winning designer Zoe Mellor in 1998, Toby Tiger is family-run brand offering baby and kids clothes up to age eight. The label specialises in and is instantly recognisable by its fun prints, which include everything from farm animals and boats to ice cream, rainbows and even lift-the-flap appliques. Guaranteed to get a big thumbs up from children and their parents, the clothes are super-soft, GOTS-certified and incredibly practical with turn-up ankle bands and waistbands for comfy support. The brand also has a “return and earn” program, where you can send back your child’s outgrown clothes to give them a second life and earn money towards your next purchase. British brand Another Fox creates bold graphic printed clothing for women and kids. A great place for those looking for something a little different, you’ll find sweatshirts, vests, trousers, coats and sleepsuits in a range of fun prints, from monochrome checkerboard to animal and polka dots. The children’s collections are designed to fit little ones up to age eight but Another Fox also shares fabrics across its women’s range too, meaning you can create a little mini-me moment. Want to bring a little fun to your child’s wardrobe? Then consider adding something from Wexbaby – a French-inspired kidswear brand launched by two sisters, Ettie and Sally. Available in sizes newborn up to six years, the label is bursting with clothes that are full of personality and comical illustrations, whether that’s Wexbaby’s signature French man Pépé, a snail riding a skateboard or a frog playing the violin. Made from the softest fabric and designed with durability in mind, you can feel good about buying from this company too, as it donates 20 per cent of its sales to The Fostering Network. Founded by Swedish illustrator Cassandra Rhodin, this brand is on the more premium side but the price is reflected in the quality. Destined to be the talk of the playground, each piece features quirky and fun prints spanning everything from psychic cats to pelicans and the Loch Ness monster.

      "title": "Nigeria needs more courts, judges – Oladipo Okpeseyi, SAN",
      "text": "What inspired you to study Law? My father was one. He was a fan of Chief Rotimi Williams (a popular lawyer), and most of the times, he was in the news. My father would buy the papers to read and discuss matters in the news. Even though I was quiet young, we exchanged views about it. That was how I got to know ‘Timi the law’ and with all our exchanges, I felt it was a good course to study. Most of the influence came from him (my father). What are the peculiar responsibilities that come with being a SAN? I give glory to God. It is a privilege conferred by the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee on those that are judged to be deserving members of the Bar, who have attain certain levels in society. By that singular conferment, one is identified as a role model in the legal profession. That places on one’s shoulder the responsibility to mentor others, and to project the finest of the legal profession. What are the common challenges that legal practitioners face in Nigeria? In Nigeria, one basic thing I have seen over the years is that there are people who are not lawyers but act as if they are better than lawyers, and that is a big problem. However, I have noticed that it is not peculiar to the legal profession. It is more of a Nigerian thing. A man could take his vehicle to a garage and tell whoever is going to work on it that the problem is from the carburetor. Also, a man could go to the hospital and tell the doctor he has a headache. That is the same way people come to a lawyer and dictate what the lawyer should do. But, if they knew the problem in the first place, they should solve it themselves. Just like a doctor will need to run tests to know what the problem is and the best way to treat it, lawyers would need to do preliminary findings as well. But, some people don’t like paying for legal services. A lawyer could prepare an agreement about 15 years ago for a particular client, and the client would continue to adopt and copy that same agreement for every other tenant. Unknown to people like that, for every tenancy agreement, there is a unique thing about the two parties. It is only when they find themselves in court that they realise that the agreement they are holding does not even support their claim. Things would be better if people allow professionals do their jobs. How have you been able to overcome those challenges? One must accept the nature of one’s society. By virtue of my background, one has to do some pro-bono jobs to help people out and during the process, one has the privilege of enlightening them. There are some jobs that one realises is easier for one to do and go away without asking to be paid, rather than wasting valuable time asking for one’s fees. What are the highlights of your legal career? I have been influenced a lot by my colleagues, and my contemporaries who bring matters to me. That gives me the impression that I am doing something right. There was an instance when the late Kehinde Shofola, who was one of the ‘tough men in the profession’, was involved. I was in court for a case against a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, and Shofola came in. Usually whenever a SAN comes into court, the judge calls as a form of courtesy to them, but he chose not to interrupt, even though the judge was about to. He sat through our address, and there was an issue. When there are terms of settlement, they must be signed by both the parties and lawyers, and then filed in court. But, I took a position against that. This was an oral agreement by the parties in an open court. The court recorded it, and the two lawyers were there. But, my colleague was saying that because it was not put in paper and signed by the parties and the lawyer, it was not a term of settlement that the court could take cognizance of. But, I took exception to that. I felt that what was the whole institution of the court if we could not hold the judge who held and recorded the agreement of the parties as value for all times? What is the whole privilege of a lawyer appearing for a client, in this case, who was also present in court, address the court on an issue? As far as I was concerned, we were not been truthful. So, I made my argument forcefully and with a high level of disappointment. By the time we finished, Shofola stood up and said, “My lord, I am impressed, and it gives me hope that the profession would do even better than what we have done.” For a young lawyer like me, those words kept reechoing in my head, even till now. I was impressed and happy with myself, I felt encouraged and inspired and I thought to myself that I must be doing something right. Another highlight had to with another case. I was privileged to have a meeting with FRA Williams in his chambers on a matter and I also encountered him on a matter. It was at a special appeal tribunal at the Court of Appeal. He took a position of the law that if one was to hold any serious office and one had more than five per cent interest, one had to disclose it. His client, who also happened to be a lawyer, did not disclose any interest. The gentleman was the chairman of a bank, and he was signing pieces of paper, not even cheque, that were acknowledged and recognised. We put all those pieces of evidence together and argued. As God would have it, the judgment went our way. I was very happy to have met two of my mentors, and knew that I could take on anything. As a member of the National Prosecution Coordinating Committee, what were your roles? That was one of the brightest initiatives the immediate past Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, set up. He called me and some others with a mandate to decongest the flood of old corrupt cases of prominent people clogging the courts. Our duty was to call for the case files and review the evidence. If the evidence was not good enough, we would return it for investigation. If the evidence was strong but the legal team was not, we would recommend to him to strengthen the legal representation on the prosecution side. And then, if there was nothing against those people strong enough to sustain those cases in court, we would recommend to him that they should be discontinued. Also, we were not to take any of the cases, or earn any money, aside from sitting allowance. It was a volunteer job, and we were cleared for it. I readily agreed to give my support, but one way or the other, agencies of government did not corporate with us. Another mandate we had was to set up legal teams made up of at least one senior lawyer, two medium lawyers and at least one lawyer from the Ministry of Justice to develop manpower. We set up those teams of not more than five lawyers, so that when there were tough matters, they could just take one of the teams to go and join the prosecution on that matter. By this, he wanted to develop manpower in the Ministry of Justice, so that things could go smoothly. But, the agencies did not corporate with us. It got to a point that we had meetings in the office of the National Security Adviser, who also called for the files, but the files never came for our review. The Attorney General had good intentions, and we set up about 60 teams of lawyers all over the country. Any of the teams that wanted to deal with the matter, must, after looking at the matter, disclose if they had any interest. If they had do, they must stay away from it. It was a genuine initiative but the system frustrated it. The National Security Adviser also wrote on it, but they refused to release those files, so we had nothing to review. We did rules of procedure for our conduct, as well as rules of engagement, and they were all approved. But ultimately, the system did not allow us work. What are the benefits a lawyer stands to gain by being a member of the International Bar Association? The legal practice, like any other profession, needs to carry our peer reviews; and the International Bar Association is an opportunity for that. It provides an avenue for lawyers to network, and see how others are doing. It also opens a global window for one. A colleague of one could be in Australia, and there is something they need to be done in Nigeria. They could call on one; and vice-versa. You are a former chairman of the reputable Island Club. What do you recall of your time in that position? The name of the club is ‘D Island Club.’ It is referred to as the premier social club in Nigeria. These days, people see it as a club of socialites but that is not what the club is about. The club was founded in 1943, while Yoruba Tennis Club was founded in 1926, and Ikoyi Club in 1938, Lagos Lawn Tennis Club was founded in 1895. There were many clubs before D Island Club, but it is is the premier social club in the country. That was the place where black and white people met under one roof in Sub-Sahara Africa to check on reality. Island Club came as a revolution to fight racism, and the founding members of the club fought it to a standstill, together with white men that were sympathetic to the course of the black men. Most of them had schooled abroad and had returned to their country, but there was segregation. It was because of this that D Island Club came to be. It became a home for intellectuals. The roles of the chairman of the club include to give direction to good governance and political issues. Yes, we might have lost track of some of those things, but we still have the men. For instance, there have been so many issues that have required D Island Club’s intervention in recent times. Ours is to assist government in its policy formulation and governance. If we are going to criticise, we would also proffer solutions. If we are going to support, we would give our reasons for that as well. While I was chairman, we did quite a bit of that. You were conferred with the national honour of Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic by former President Muhammadu Buhari. Were you expecting it and how did it make you feel? I was told in 2012/2014, but nothing came. I don’t know what I had done to deserve it, but it is a recognition I am grateful for. I thank former President Muhammadu Buhari. I felt honoured. What are the cases you handled in the course of your career that stood out for you? I have handled so many cases, and I don’t know which ones brought me to limelight; but I know that doing political matters added to it. In 2011, I was the lead counsel for the Congress for Progressive Change, and Buhari was the presidential candidate then. I have always had a public life, even though I am a conservative person. I have done quite a number of things in litigation, as well as corporate and commercial practice in a career spanning over 36 years. However, the ones that touched me the most were securing the acquittal of people who had been convicted and were on death row at the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. Some of them did not even know where to go or how to leave the prison after they were discharged and acquitted by the Supreme Court. I feel that the issue of false accusations should have another angle to it. If anybody reports something that is false to the police, there should be repercussions. Those things should not be taken lightly. What improvement will you like to see in the judiciary? There are a lot of them. First, I believe the way of handling election petitions should be reviewed, because the harm it is doing to the system is more than the good. Most of the courts don’t do anything other than handle election petition cases. One can as well say that the entire country is on standstill. We need to look for a better way of dealing with election petitions. It is either we call retired judges— people with probity— to sit on those panels. Also, members of the judiciary need to be properly remunerated. If one is a magistrate, that seat should be comfortable enough for one to retire. If one is a high court judge, the seat should be comfortable enough for one to retire as one. The same goes for judges of the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. I believe the remuneration of judges should be tied to their years of meritorious service. A magistrate can earn more than the high court judge in some cases. In that jurisdiction, he (magistrate) is known and if he is not forthright, he should be removed. Having got to that level, they should be able to live in some measure of comfort, as their job isolates them from doing so many things, including associating freely with friends. In that case, they should be comfortable enough. Another issue is that there aren’t enough courts, particularly in the commercial nerve centres (Lagos, Abuja, Kaduna, Benin, Port Harcourt and Ibadan). No court should have to hear more than two or three cases in a day. And, if a lawyer does not show up after being allocated time and space, they should be heavily fined. Also, conference for judges should be scheduled a year ahead, so that judicial hours are not spent on those things. Once they have adjourned the matter to a particular date, there shouldn’t be any reason for a conference to be slated for that date. If they already have a one-year notice for a conference, they would avoid scheduling other things for that date. It is also unfortunate that we don’t have enough judges. In some countries, a state like Lagos would have more than 3,000 high courts. Even if you take the National Industrial Court, Federal High Court and the Lagos State High Court, they are still insufficient to service Lagos. We need to get people on the bench and create room for them by building more courts. The ambiance of the court should let people know that they are in the temple of justice. I believe we need more judicial officers. There was a recent report that a large number of fresh lawyers end up in Lagos State. Why is that? I don’t know for sure, but Lagos is one of the commercial nerve centres of the country. The fact that there is an influx of people into Lagos on a daily basis is the reason it is one of the most populated city by landmass in the world. So, it is not surprising that there will also be a large number of lawyers there. What can you recall of your childhood? I had a very modest background, and it is by the grace of God I am where I am today. My parent attended the Anglican Church, and I am still a member of the church. They were also involved in community matters, and I am involved in that too in a way. Who are the people you admire, and those that have impacted your life in one way or the other? In my sober moments, I always remember one man— George Ngene. He is a gentleman par excellence. I was working for the then National Oil as a lawyer, when he had an issue, and the matter was assigned to me. I did my best and left. He wanted to pay me, but I refused, saying that since the legal manager assigned the case to me, I would send my bill to him. I always like for people to know and appreciate me for who I am. And, if they don’t know me, they should leave me for who I am. Whenever I have the opportunity, I do my best. That is the biggest lesson I have learnt over the years, and that is why I do all my jobs to the best of my ability. Do you have any plan of retiring soon? In this profession, there is no retirement. I have come to realise that there are levels in life. What just happens is that when one gets to a particular point, one would have to limit the things one does. My mentors did not retire until they died. What do you think are the necessary qualities one should possess in order to attain success? I believe people should know what they want. If one knows what one wants, one should focus on it, and not beat around the bush. One does not have to share it with the whole world. One should just keep it between oneself and one’s God, and be working towards it. How have you been able to balance work and famly life in a way that none suffers? If one has a balanced life, it is because of the people around one that are helping one to stabilise with the grace of God. Without God and good people around one, one is nobody. Is any of your children showing interest in law? Yes. What do you consider to be your greatest success? Knowing God How do you like to dress? I like to dress casually and simply. What is your favourite meal? I don’t know. I am just grateful that the meal is even there for me to eat. How do you unwind? I am a golfer. I go there (golf course) to relax. I also go clubbing, and attend events with my friends.",

      "title": "&#039;One Piece&#039; Animation Team Talks Fave Wano Episodes &amp; Teases Egghead Island Arc - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "The year 2023 is a special time to be a One Piece fan. It has brought on several milestones for the franchise, with the over 25-year-long manga finally reaching its final stretch of the story, the live-action series at Netflix getting a release date, and the anime’s stellar animation and upcoming Gear 5 episode, which sees Luffy get a legendary (and powerful) transformation. Each episode leading toward the climatic reveal of Luffy’s new form has garnered critical acclaim from critics and fans alike on Twitter, elevating freelance animators like Vincent Chansard and Henry Thurlow into household names within the fandom. At Anime Expo 2023, TV Insider got the chance to speak to the One Piece Series Director (Yasunori Koyama), Animation Director (Kenji Yokoyama), and Production Manager (Tetsushi Akahori) ahead of One Piece Day (July 21 and 22) to discuss their favorite moments in the current Wano Kuni arc and the upcoming Egghead Island arc. Can you confirm the date of the highly anticipated Gear 5 episode? Kenji Yokoyama: We can’t confirm as of now, but just based on the original [manga], you can tell it’s gotta be soon. Is there something you can tease for the upcoming July-August episodes? Yokoyama: Luffy and Kaido are in it. [Laughs] What are your favorite scenes of the Wano arc thus far that you’ve worked on/overseen? Yokoyama: I’m particularly responsible for the original drawings for the series, and there are many, many memories of doing it, but particularly in that arc, the scene where Otama is eating Oshiruko (Red Bean Soup). That’s something that I really put my heart into drawing. And particularly, I have very strong feelings about how Luffy’s face, Luffy’s expressions, appeared at that time. Interesting. What about Luffy’s expressions were more important to nail in this arc than any other? Yokoyama: So I’ve done a lot of this, and one thing, in particular, is that Luffy’s a character who, even if he’s getting angry, doesn’t really appear frightening or threatening, and there’s something about his very kind of happy-go-lucky easygoing quality in his face in his expressions that’s really important to me. What was your favorite scene in this arc? Yasunori Koyama: I’m really pleased. I mean, I’ve lots of memories of all the episodes I’ve been involved with. But in particular, I think Episode 971 in the Wano Kuni series. That’s where Oden goes to Kaido, and you know, there’s a way in which he, Oden, kind of in a stupid way, is still suffering a lot for everyone’s purpose to save everyone. And I think there is something in the way also in which he brings his samurai to fight; there’s something that comes from the Japanese. We’ve got maybe kind of a national identity but not exactly a national identity, but there’s something that comes out of the tradition of Japanese samurai movies that we can see here, and I feel that idea of kind of like suffering and taking on a lot for the group is really important here. Tetsushi Akahori: I work at the production level as a producer. I don’t draw particular episodes, but I think I can make a contribution of my own here, telling you about what I appreciate or seen that’s particularly important for me, and that’s Episode 892. … That’s a scene where the kind of look, the background, the kind of atmosphere of One Piece changes, and I felt that when it was broadcast, I was really, really pleased that we were kind of producing a new kind of One Piece and that [it received] such [a] strong positive audience reaction made me feel really happy. Is there a consensus or any strict rules on the aura effect for haki? Or is creative control left up to the animators? Akahori: There are some general rules at the kind of broadest level, yes. But each animator has their own particular style, and we actually want to encourage that. Yes. I love all the haki, by the way. Everyone: [Laughs] Will the current Land of Wano art style be used once we progress toward the Egghead Island arc? Koyama: So, of course, you know, they’re very different. The Wano Kuni and Egghead are very different arcs. And so we will be choosing or adopting a style that’s best that will, you know, promote or be best for Egghead Island. Yeah. So that’s something that we’re contemplating now.",

      "title": "Developers had direct influence over Ontario Greenbelt land removal, AG finds",
      "text": "Developers in Ontario had direct influence over the province’s decision to extract lands from the Greenbelt and received “preferential treatment,” Ontario’s auditor general found in a blistering special report that showed the Ford government began working to remove protected land as soon as it won re-election. The explosive report from Bonnie Lysyk into the government’s dealings with developers comes after a six-month investigation and interviews with key players in the controversial decision, including Premier Doug Ford, who denied any wrongdoing. The report, however, makes a definitive link between the Premier’s Office, the housing minister, a central political staffer who drove the project, and developers who benefitted from the deal. The end result: the owners of 15 parcels of land removed from the Greenbelt will see the value rise by $8.3 billion, according to the auditor general. Among the key findings: In a June 2022 mandate letter, Premier Doug Ford directed Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark to conduct “swaps, expansions, contractions and policy updates” related to the Greenbelt.The chief of staff to Clark, “working under the authority” of the Premier’s Office, implemented the policy.The chief of staff received “packages” from “two prominent housing developers” with specific sites to target.A team of government employees, bound by confidentiality, were given just three weeks to identify and assess up to 22 parcels of land for removal.When the lands failed to meet the development standards to allow for removal, the criteria was changed to specifically allow pieces of land owned by developers with access to the government to be removed.Of the 7,400 acres extracted, 6,700 — or 92 per cent — was removed as a direct result of developer access to the chief of staff. Directive came from Premier Doug Ford’s office Bonnie Lysyk’s report found that immediately after the June 2022 election, Housing Minister Steve Clark was given a new mandate letter for the government’s second term in office. “Following the June 2, 2022, general election, the Premier directed the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing (Housing Minister) in a mandate letter dated June 29, 2022, to ‘complete work to codify processes for swaps, expansions, contractions and policy updates for the Greenbelt,’” the report states. The report said the letter instructed Clark to complete the work in the fall of 2022. Lysyk said the actual responsibility to find specific pieces of land fell to the minister’s chief of staff, working at the direction of Premier Ford’s office. While Lysyk’s report does not name the chief of staff, government records and a LinkedIn profile indicate Ryan Amato has held the position of chief of staff to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing since July 2022. Amato was appointed by the Premier’s Office, the report said, the same month work on the Greenbelt changes began. Amato, the report notes, then met with developers to identify specific pieces of land, overruled provincial bureaucrats, and initiated a site-specific review — a decision that Lysyk said “ultimately facilitated a focus on only specific developers’ land sites” rather than a system-wide review of the Greenbelt. Global News sent questions to Amato, whose email has an out-of-the-office response. He did not respond in time for publication. The Greenbelt Project Team Lysyk’s investigation concluded that the Ford government’s decision-making process was tightly controlled, secretive and rushed. A small team of six, non-political staffers within the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing was set up to work on the land removal plan in October 2022. Named the Greenbelt Project Team, the group was governed by strict confidentiality and worked on a tight timeline. The auditor general’s report said the Greenbelt Project Team was given just three weeks to assess what protected land could be removed. The task force was originally given eight pieces of land to consider in its short timeline by Amato with 13 new sites later added. Lysyk said the team was also asked to suggest other new sites for removal. Amato told the auditor general he regularly goes to development events where stakeholders “at times” pass along requests for land they would like to see removed from the Greenbelt. At an event on Sept. 14, 2022, for example, two “prominent developers” gave Amato packages containing information about two Greenbelt sites they wanted to see removed, the report said. “The Chief of Staff sat at the same dinner table with one of these two developers,” the audit general wrote. The developers at the event ended up with 92 per cent of the land removed from the Greenbelt, Lysyk wrote. Amato told the auditor general he did not immediately open the envelope but “kept them in a stack in his office” along with other similar requests. He said he did not tell the developers the government was considering removing land from the Greenbelt. Lysyk suggested politics governed the timeline of Greenbelt land removals. She found the tight timeline did not have a clear justification. Instead, it was chosen to “complete the project so that the announcement of Greenbelt land removals and additions could coincide with the government’s fall housing legislation.” The three-week sprint was controlled by strict confidentiality agreements that prevented the team from consulting with anyone about its work. That made it impossible for the government to get feedback from experts and partners like local cities, ministries and Indigenous communities, the auditor general found. Lysyk’s report said the criteria for removing land also shifted under the feet of the Greenbelt Project Team. Originally, the group was asked to identify if land could be serviced for wastewater, roads and other local infrastructure. After telling Amato it would be impossible within the three-week window, Lysyk’s report said the province agreed to look just at Greenbelt land that bordered existing built-up areas. The report also said questions about environmental and agricultural issues with building housing on the land were included in the original scope. However, when the Greenbelt team decided all eight of the first batch of land assigned to it would fall foul of the rule, the requirement was dropped. Changes were also made to several sites ultimately removed from the Greenbelt in order to make them fit other criteria, the report said. Lysyk said the process had such a “narrow project scope and tight timelines” that the Greenbelt team only found one additional site it would consider removing. Despite the fact that 630 requests were sent to the province asking to remove land from the Greenbelt, the team reviewed only 22 pieces of land. Ninety-five per cent of the land parcels reviewed by the team were handed to them by Clark’s chief of staff, and 92 per cent of the acreage removed from the Greenbelt was contained in five land sites passed on to the Housing Minister’s chief of staff from two developers. Ford denies wrongdoing As part of her probe, Lysyk interviewed Premier Ford, who denied having personal conversations with developers about the land swap or personally selecting the lands that were eventually removed from the Greenbelt. The premier, the report states, was given a briefing on Nov. 1, 2022 — one day before the announcement was made public — and was then shown the 15 pieces of land slated for removal. Ford claimed that was the first time he reviewed the specific list of Greenbelt lands and indicated that he did not “instruct political or non-political staff to have certain land sites removed from the Greenbelt.” Elected officials, the report indicates, also attempted to pin the blame on Amato as the linchpin in the Greenbelt plan. “The Premier and the Minister of Housing have communicated to us that they were unaware that the pre-selection of lands for removal from the Greenbelt was biassed, controlled and directed by the Housing Minister’s Chief of Staff,” the report states. Internally, however, civil servants tasked with carrying out the government’s expectations had a clear view of the chain of command: “Political staff understood that most of the land sites were provided by the Housing Minister’s Chief of Staff, who took direction from the Minister and Premier’s Office.” The report also indicated that while the Ford government has “no current intention” of carving out additional lands from the Greenbelt, senior staff in the Premier’s Office believed that to be the plan. “The Chief of Staff of the Premier’s Office confirmed the intention was to continue with future land removal from the Greenbelt and that the 2022 process to alter the boundaries of the Greenbelt had not been intended to be a one-time exercise,” the report said. Greenbelt lands not needed for housing target Under a volley of criticism from opposition parties, the Ford government has argued land had to be removed from the Greenbelt to meet its target of 1.5 million new homes in Ontario by 2031. The auditor general’s report, however, says a range of key planning figures told the province the Greenbelt could remain untouched without impacting its housing goal. Top municipal planning staff in Durham, Halton and York Regions — where the land removed from the Greenbelt is located — told the auditor general the removed land was not required to meet the housing targets. They said much of the land would be difficult to service under the timelines set by the province. They also said housing targets to deliver the 1.5 million homes had already been assigned to them by October 2022, before protected land was removed. Those targets came from a separate team at the province, which told the auditor general it had assigned housing targets “without the knowledge” the Greenbelt would be carved up within weeks. No enforcement plan in place Lysyk’s report found the province has not put any formal process in place to monitor if developers actually make good on their promise to build housing in time. One of the key conditions for removing land from the Greenbelt was that the construction of new homes begins no later than 2025. If developers didn’t make progress, the Ford government had promised to return the land to the Greenbelt. “However, we found that, as (of) June 2023, neither the Housing Ministry nor the government had further defined their expectations in order for performance indicators to be established and targets set so that progress and results can be objectively monitored, measured and publicly reported,” the report said. The time constraints put on Greenbelt staff mean the Ford government doesn’t know how much of the land will be built on by 2025, the report found. “If these conditions are not met, the government will return these lands to the Greenbelt without hesitation,” the government told the auditor.",

      "title": "Game theory? It's a piece of cake! Author reveals how a branch of mathematics used by Wall Street...",
      "text": "Ordering one dessert and two forks is always a risk. But that feeling of resentment towards the person across the table taking more than their fair share could have an elegantly simple solution... Game theory. The branch of applied mathematics - more often used by Wall Street brokers trying to figure out when to sell stock - can also be applied to a slice of cheesecake or chocolate cake, according to a recent book. To prevent one person in a couple, or a greedy friend, from taking the lion's share, one of them should move a knife from left to right across the slice, with either person shouting 'stop' when they think it has reached the halfway point. The person who says stop gets the left-hand piece, which they are content with because they believe it is half the dessert. The book, Numbers: Ten Things You Should Know, by Colin Stuart, suggests people should forget everything they know about how to cut a cake Meanwhile the person who stayed quiet gets the right-hand piece and is more than happy - believing they have more than half, as otherwise they would have yelled stop previously. This 'envy-free' solution means neither person is annoyed about the other's portion. The theory, which has been around for several decades but is little known outside of maths circles, is included in a new book explaining mathematical theory and its applications in real life, by Colin Stuart, a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. He said: 'The moving-knife solution means everyone is happy, even if the cake is not actually shared 50/50, because neither person feels they have lost out. 'It is a good way of showing how mathematicians and scientists can be strangely quite whimsical - several of them have set their minds to the puzzle of how best to divide a cake.' The book, Numbers: Ten Things You Should Know, by Colin Stuart, suggests people should forget everything they know about how to cut a cake. Slicing triangle-shaped pieces out of it is not the best method if you want to keep the cake moist and prevent it drying out. Instead, you should cut a long, thin wedge from the exact centre of the cake, and 'squidge' the remaining two pieces together to keep the inside away from exposure to the air. The method, explained in the book, is the invention of scientist Francis Galton, the half-cousin of Charles Darwin. It suggests people should go back to the cake with the vertical wedge removed and take their next slice by cutting a horizontal wedge across the middle. The remaining cake pieces can again be pushed together to keep the inside moist - with the help of a rubber band, according to Galton, who published a letter on the subject in prestigious science journal Nature in 1906. The book also describes a solution for three people sharing a cake where different parts of it are more delicious - for example if some areas of the cake have more buttercream or chocolate sprinkles. If three people called Tom, Dan and Sarah are quarrelling over their share, Tom can cut the cake into three pieces - any of which he would be happy to receive. Dan and Sarah can choose their piece, and if they choose different ones, everyone is content, according to the theory devised in the 1960s. The theory, which has been around for several decades but is little known outside of maths circles, is included in a new book explaining mathematical theory and its applications in real life, by Colin Stuart, a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society But if they choose the same one, Sarah should cut a sliver off her favourite piece until she thinks it has the same amount of sprinkles or buttercream as her second favourite, and then Dan should choose one of these two slices. Whichever he chooses, Sarah won't mind, as she thinks both are equal in value, and she will take the other. And Tom will be happy with the third piece which hasn't changed since he cut it. All that remains is for the sliver cut off the cake to be shared out, which starts the process again, but with the person who got the trimmed slice getting to cut the sliver up first. There is even, as of seven years ago, an algorithm for how to share a cake between four people, but the book concludes it might be simpler to just 'get a cake for everyone'.",

      "title": "Gold Can’t Be Downgraded And It’s No One’s Liability - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "“We have gold because we cannot trust governments,” President Herbert Hoover It’s not often I get to quote the much-maligned Herbert Hoover. This quote, made in 1933, was another piece of Hoover’s advice that incoming President Roosevelt ignored. Shortly thereafter, Roosevelt passed the Emergency Banking Act, which forced all Americans to convert their gold coins, bullion, and certificates into US dollars. Then he immediately devalued the US dollar. Desperate to cure deflation, Roosevelt, as we know, tried manifold pro-inflation tactics. Was currency devaluation successful? Economists are still debating it. Fast forward to August 1, 2023, a period which our government tells us is now about inflation reduction, to see the following headline: “Fitch Ratings has downgraded the United States of America government debt”. Basically, Fitch states the obvious, that the United States is on a debt-issuing binge with no current plan or governance ability to stop. According to Bank of America BAC , based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, US public debt will rise by $5.2 Billion every day for the next 10 years! Somewhere, Herbert Hoover is saying “see, I told you so!” What does this mean? What are the ramifications? Well, for history buffs like me, the first place to go is the textbook and analyze the last time, if ever, that this happened. We seem to be living through a market where the sample size is always 1; the last, and only, time that US debt was downgraded was on August 5, 2011. At that time, US government debt was about $13 Trillion having risen quickly during and after the GFC. Recently, USdebtclock.org, said we are in hook for about $33 Trillion, which is over $250k per taxpayer. The CBO projects a rapid increase over the next decade as we borrow to pay interest expenses and social programs. Are we at a tipping point now? Impossible to know but certainly worth risk managing for your portfolio. The downgrade does not mean we won’t pay back our debts; we issue them in dollars and have a lot of printing presses. Default is a non-starter. But the downgrade, the endless budget, trade, and capital deficits further increase the threat to the US dollar’s reign as the reserve currency. As I write this, the BRICS (China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Russia), nations are meeting in South Africa to “blunt western dominance.” They increasingly do not want our liability. These nations are roughly already equal to the G7 in GDP and will quickly pass the G7 as new entrants join (Saudi Arabia, UAE UAE , and Indonesia). There is no western dominance more pervasive than US dollar hegemony. I guess it will be on their agenda for “blunting”. Making portfolio decisions in times like this is difficult. But it continues to lead me to building as diversified a portfolio as possible. As my readers know, I strongly support gold as a critical component of this diversification, now more than ever. Gold, in all its simplicity, exposes the shortcomings of the dollar as a savings instrument. Unlike any country’s debt, gold is no one’s liability and should help protect a portfolio against currency swoons. Gold is rare (we cannot just print more of it), it can also be stored, transported, and divided. What do these BRIC nations think of gold? They are big fans. According to the World Gold Council, Russia, China, and India are all top 5 physical gold buyers since 2010. Central Bank purchasing of gold remains robust. I highlighted this in a piece I wrote back in January, which I invite you to read (When The Gold Dust Settled (forbes.com) ). As reported by the World Gold Council, Central Bank demand for gold through the first half of 2023 finished at 387t, the highest in the data series’ history. Whether or not 2023 totals will top that of 2022’s record level of Central Bank gold purchasing (over 1,000 total tonnes), remains to be seen. Regardless, this should be coupled with the fact that, as reported by Alpine Macro, Central Banks’ US Dollar composition has fallen from over 70% in 2000 to under 60% today. The decision surrounding Central Bank balance sheets does not change course quickly. These are long-term course changes happening now. One other piece of data I want to share (and also highlighted in the January piece referenced above) is gold’s performance during yield curve inversions. I will actually copy and paste an exact paragraph from that piece: “Since 1973, I analyzed 5 periods of sustained inversion between 3 month and 10-year rates. Gold held its ground during each inversion period (the worst down 1.8%). Again, I went a step further and coupled this with our proprietary asset forecasting models. Today, our models predict gold to be in its highest quintile of projected returns (and equities in its lowest), which is similar to the 2000 inversion cycle. Upon exiting that inversion, gold nearly doubled over the next five years while equities were essentially flat.” Well, since the yield curve inverted in late October, gold is up around 13% (on par, if not better than gold’s performance during past inversions highlighted above). So, what am I watching closely now? Exactly what I outlined in the January piece… the un-inversion of the yield curve, which has historically produced some of gold’s best returns. While the set up continues to be strong, we don’t advocate more than a 25% position for gold in portfolios. In addition, one should be methodical as they increase their allocation. There will very likely be plenty of corrections between now and the moment of yield curve un-inversion. The Fed continues to remain steadfast in keeping rates higher for longer, real rates are the highest that they have been in 14 years, and we may see a brief turnaround in the inflation trend off the back of recent energy strength. All of this leads me to encourage readers to buy on weakness, because the shiny metal has proven to go and go fast when its moment comes. Not everything old Hoover did or said was wrong. I’m with Herbie on this one. I don’t trust our government, as currently operating, with our currency.",

      "title": "Fall Arts Preview 2023: 10 Must-See Exhibitions",
      "text": "Some of the most anticipated art exhibitions are opening this fall, from Marina Abramovic’s 50-year retrospective at the Royal College of Art in London to the John Waters retrospective at the Academy Awards Museum in Los Angeles. What follows are 10 not-to-miss exhibitions opening soon at New York’s best museums and institutions around the globe. Marina Abramovic at the Royal College of Arts in London Belgrade-born, New York-based performance art icon Marina Abramovic has made history her entire life. She was the first woman to be recognized as a performance artist in the 1970s and helped elevate performance art into pop culture with artworks like The Artist is Present (2010) and Rhythm 0 (1975), especially in the way she used her own body to push the limits of performance art. Now the 76-year-old artist is making history as the first woman artist to ever get a retrospective at the Royal College of Art in London. The exhibition will feature works from across her 50-year career, including photos of her groundbreaking performance work, video art, her installations and even her performance art pieces, which will be re-performed in the galleries by a group of artists trained by the Marina Abramovic Institute. It’s also the first major survey of the artist’s work in the U.K. September 23 through January 1, 2024. Mark Rothko retrospective at Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris The color field American painter Mark Rothko (1903-1970) is known for his saturated abstract paintings. But they weren’t just paintings. His large canvases made up of fuzzy blocks of color transformed abstraction and contemporary art. Now, Fondation Louis Vuitton—the enormous museum in the middle of a park in Paris—is bringing Rothko’s first retrospective to France. It will feature more than 100 artworks on loan from museums like the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Tate Museum in London, as well as rarely seen pieces from private museums. The exhibition will be laid out chronologically, starting with his landscape works from the 1930s through his early abstract works in the 1940s to his turn to darker hues in the 1950s and beyond. October 18 through April 2, 2024. Food & Fashion at the Fashion Institute of Technology Museum in New York City The intersection of food and fashion, both core elements of our everyday lives, is more comedic than you think. Look at the burger handbag designed by Delvaux in 2017 or the chocolate bar gown designed by Jeremy Scott at Moschino in 2014. Food & Fashion is a group exhibition featuring more than 80 garments, accessories and other items that show why the New York Times called “food motifs… the new florals.” Fashion designers on view include Chanel, Comme des Garçons and Stella McCartney with pieces that show how important food is to fashion, from fast food to the kitchen and restaurants, drawing a parallel between haute couture and haute cuisine. Featuring items that date back to the 18th century, the exhibition includes a French gown from 1765 and a peanut butter-and-jelly-sandwich hat by hat designer Stephen Jones. September 13 through November 26, 2023. Nicolas de Staël at the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris While his name might not be as recognized as Monet or Renoir, the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris is devoting a major retrospective to French artist Nicolas de Staël, who lived from 1914 to 1955. The Russian-born French painter was a key figure in post-war French art, and he’s known for minimalist, rather graphic abstract paintings that are smart and serene. He was a friend of the trailblazing Dadaist Jean Arp in the 1940s during the Second World War, as well as of Cubist Georges Braque. Overlooked but not forgotten, it has been 20 years since the artist had his work honored in a retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in 2003, and now they’re featuring his lesser-known works from Antibes, which is where he spent the latter years of his life. More than 200 paintings will be shown, 50 of which are coming to a French museum for the first time. September 14 through January 21, 2024. John Waters: Pope of Trash at the Academy Awards Museum in Los Angeles If there is one independent filmmaker who has made an impact on mainstream culture, it is John Waters. The Baltimore filmmaker, artist and writer is being honored in an exhibition at the Academy Awards Museum in Los Angeles—of all places—called John Waters: Pope of Trash. It’s making history as the first exhibition solely dedicated to Waters’ contributions to cinema. Starting from his humble, no-budget beginnings, this exhibition looks at his filmmaking process, gritty style, the comedic aspect that underpins all his works and his influence on pop culture. Expect to see costumes from his films, props, scripts (some of which are handwritten), letters, photographs, film clips and more. It was the famed writer William S. Burroughs who first called Waters the “pope of trash.” This exhibition shows how his work is more than that and how he challenged the status quo with films like Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble, Serial Mom and Hairspray. September 17 through August 4, 2024. Fashion and Sports: From one Podium to Another at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris Paris has all eyes on the 2024 Olympics, which open in the city on July 26, 2024. Aligning with the hype, the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris is opening an exhibition called Fashion and Sports: From one Podium to Another featuring more than 450 pieces of clothing, photos, sketches, magazines and posters that showcase the evolution of athletic wear and the influence of sportswear on fashion. Expect to see designs by Lanvin, Chanel and Schiaparelli; the evolution of the tracksuit and the origins of sneakerhead culture. September 20 through April 7, 2024. Manet/Degas at The Met Fifth Avenue in New York City Known art world frenemies Edgar Degas and Édouard Manet had a complicated relationship. The duo met as friends, were rivals at times and, in between, helped shape the face of modern painting in France. Manet/Degas on view this fall at The Met Fifth Avenue looks at how their tumultuous relationship seeped into their artworks through portraits, landscapes and more in this exhibition of more than 150 paintings and drawings. More than anything else, this exhibition will be a dialogue between two icons of 19th-century French art history, and it includes four drawings of Manet made by Degas, as well as Degas drawings of Manet and his wife Suzanne. Visitors will also see Manet’s famous painting Olympia from 1863—-the first time the work will be shown in the U.S.—and the Degas portrait of the Bellelli Family, on loan from the Musée d’Orsay in Paris. September 24 through January 7, 2024. Sarah Lucas at Tate Britain in London British artist Sarah Lucas is known for her cheeky sculptures of female figures and her use of stuffed pantyhose in her Bunny series. Now the artist, well known as one of the Young British Artists from the 1990s alongside Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, is having a retrospective at the Tate Britain called Happy Gas. The exhibition features her early works from the 1980s, pieces from the 1990s that got her well known in the art world and her most recent body of work, including pieces made of bronze. September 28 through January 14, 2024. Chagall at Work at the Pompidou in Paris Marc Chagall, who lived from 1887 to 1985, was a Russian-born French artist who changed the face of surrealist painting with his artworks, many of which were inspired by dreams. The Pompidou is showing 127 drawings and 12 sculptures in an exhibition called Drawings, Ceramics and Sculptures 1945-1970. The exhibition is themed around the prep drawings he made for the costume and stage curtains for The Firebird by Igor Stravinsky, as the opera commissioned the artist to make ceramics, collages and sculptures from the 1950s through the 1970s. October 4 through February 26, 2024. Louise Nevelson at Galerie Gmurzynska The American artist Louise Nevelson is known for many things: trailblazing collage as contemporary art in the early 20th century, recycling materials long before it was trendy and making a career as a woman artist when one-woman shows were rare. Now, an exhibition on view at Galerie Gmurzynska celebrates the artist’s legacy in a solo show entitled Louise Nevelson – The Way I Think Is Collage. There are 18 framed collages in the exhibition, some of which are three dimensional, offering captivating insight into the artist’s oeuvre. Materials like wood and ripped paper are shown alongside flat, abstract works that reveal the artist’s true genius—her approach to balanced composition. Through September 30. Spike Lee at the Brooklyn Museum The award-winning, critically acclaimed filmmaker, artist and director Spike Lee is finally getting a retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum. The exhibition, called Spike Lee: Creative Sources features a vast installation of objects from Lee’s collection of paraphernalia that represent Black history, politics, hip hop and cinema history, as well as an intimate glimpse into his family. The exhibit will feature artworks by Kehinde Wiley, Deborah Roberts and Michael Ray Charles with historic photographs and film memorabilia. October 6 through February 4, 2024.",

      "title": "Building The ‘Star Wars’ Universe On TV: Inside The Making Of ‘Obi-Wan Kenobi,’ ‘Andor’ And ‘The",
      "text": "Ever since 1977, Star Wars has been a franchise with recognizable aesthetics: The distinctive hum of a lightsaber. Rusty armor and billowing capes on the costumes. The iconic Millennium Falcon. GeorgeLucas created a visual legacy that filmmakers and craftspeople have continued to honor through the feature films, live-action series, video games and animated series, building completely new “lived-in and gritty” locations that entrench themselves in that ’70s sci-fi vibe. This year, “The Mandalorian,” “Andor” and “Obi-Wan Kenobi” are all vying for Emmys as they pay tribute to the beloved franchise while expanding on its world-building across various crafts. But “you can’t mess with Darth Vader,” says “Obi-Wan Kenobi” costume designer Suttirat Larlarb of the Sith Lord. The Disney+ series expands on the story of Jedi knight Obi-Wan and his former padawan (apprentice) Darth Vader. With Hayden Christensen reprising his role as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, Larlarb updated his outfit purely for mobility. “The extreme physical demands of the showdown between Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) and Darth Vader is what governed our need to re-think how to make Darth Vader for our show,” she says. “We have other processes that allow for our Darth Vader, a younger one in the ‘Star Wars’ timeline, to be more mobile and physical, helmet-to-toe. The armor he wears needed to move with his body in a way that allowed the fights to happen fluidly — and not prevent him from doing anything that was dreamed up.” Similarly, for McGregor, it was the script that offered the costume designer insight as to how events would unfold and helped with her costume choices. “The challenge is that he’s hiding on Tatooine, a place where the clothing is very innately similar to Jedi clothing in terms of construction, cut and fabric,” she says of the blue tunic Obi-Wan sports in the pilot. “It has basic geometric component parts in loose-weave and drapey fabrics.” The key was not to introduce him in colors he’s traditionally associated with — yet. “With the blue, we can understand that he is not the same Jedi legend. As a Tatooine citizen, he has a more relaxed, less structured feel than the Jedi elite. We could play on the shapes of the garments to the degree where I was making choices that were less architectural than the Jedi [clothing] language. This fits into the Tatooine language, and this is the main factor. He’s hiding in plain sight among Tatooine’s population.” By the end of the episode, he shifts to a more familiar silhouette, but “the precision of his Jedi look doesn’t come until later in the series. We build our Obi-Wan back piece-by-piece until the inarguable Jedi has returned,” Larlarb says. The drama also gives fans of the franchise Leia Organa’s backstory, as audiences meet her as a young and mischievous princess. But the key to her story and foundation lay in Queen Breha’s (Simone Kessell) style. The queen’s first costume serves several roles. Larlarb and director Deborah Chow knew that the future Princess Leia would have been impacted by the royal household she grew up in; her adopted mother would have been a major influence on how she dresses and comports herself, once she takes on her royal responsibilities. “Queen Breha’s introduction also serves as a visual counterpoint to how we introduce young Leia (Vivian Lyra Blair) in the same episode,” says Larlarb. For example, in that episode, the Organa household is hosting a royal event, and young Leia, instead of being in her room getting dressed by her staff in a formal outfit, is in her play clothes and climbing trees with her droid. “The scene where the queen stops everything to retrieve her disobedient, playsuit-clad daughter while she is dressed very formally needed to express the distance Leia still has to traverse to become the icon in that white gown we eventually know,” says Larlarb. “I wanted to make sure the references to the future, iconic Princess Leia we meet in ‘A New Hope’ were clear.” The colors of Queen Breha’s gown are intentionally related: The ivory of the dress recalls Princess Leia’s iconic gown from Lucas’ 1977 “Star Wars” while the blue, Larlarb says, is a nod to “the established colors of [their planet of Alderaan]” yet elevated for the royal event. The motif on the blue lining of her cape also has special significance. “I asked Lucasfilm’s Pablo Hidalgo if there were certain flowers associated with Alderaan, as I wanted to employ this notion that [family] symbols on royal clothing throughout history are often derived from the flora and fauna of the royal realm, and that the queens often express a connection to their homeland by wearing clothes whose textiles incorporate the use of those symbols through embellishment.” A “Star Wars” manga mentions an Alderaanian flower called the “struggling pearl blossom,” so she pulled from that. She built the dress from a heavy ivory four-ply crepe to control the silhouette and keep it soft and fit, is in her play clothes and climbing trees with her droid. “The scene where the queen stops everything to retrieve her disobedient, playsuit-clad daughter while she is dressed very formally needed to express the distance Leia still has to traverse to become the icon in that white gown we eventually know,” says Larlarb. “I wanted to make sure the references to the future, iconic Princess Leia we meet in ‘A New Hope’ were clear.” Young Leia’s outfits — her playsuit with rolled-up cuffs and boots — telegraphed her rebellious spirit. “She would rather be in these comfortable play clothes and avoid the pomp and circumstance and the attire of her royal office she’s supposed to be dressed in — the magenta tunic set.” Furthermore, there needed to be something she could abandon when she runs away from the event. “When Leia rips it off as soon as she can, what’s left is the cream under-tunic and pants for the beginning of her adventure, which become the base of the other layers she dons throughout the season. But it also recalls the main color of the silhouette of the Princess Leia audiences already know from later in the timeline.” Larlarb got to introduce another new character, Moses Ingram’s Reva. As an Inquisitor, Reva’s look had to feel aesthetically related to the other characters — who had already been established in the universe — but also stand apart during their group’s first arrival together on Tatooine. Larlarb looked to established villains in the Empire — in particular, how women dressed. She started by “breaking down traditional hard armor to simplify and streamline her so that the form fit in the Inquisitor language but that the details were less flamboyant than the others.” Reva is a kind of double agent — her motive is to become Darth Vader’s trusted right hand in order to kill him and avenge the deaths of the Jedi younglings murdered by Anakin Skywalker (the eventual Darth Vader) under Order 66. “There’s a detail on her leather cuirass which is subtle. [Assistant costume designer] Stacia Lang took a series of sketch lines that I kept drawing over and over down the center front of the armor and developed it into a low and long and sharp ‘fin’ that looked like a front-facing external spine,” she explains. “Moses latched on to that detail as a reference to her divided but sharpened heart. We also had the imperial symbol bonded onto the reverse of her split cape, tone on tone, which I also saw as another way to express her conflicted allegiance.” For “The Mandalorian” costume designer Shawna Trpcic, it was about finding a way to honor the aesthetic and “give back to” the fandom, while finding ways to bring uniqueness to her characters. She hid details in the costumes for Easter eggs, a tradition she started in Season 2. But before all of that, it began with the script. Says Trpcic, “I imagine myself there, in every single scene, as a character or a warrior, and what I would do in each instance.” The third season brings back the Armorer (Emily Swallow), leader of the Mandalorian warriors on Nevarro. Trpcic wanted her costume to evolve from what fellow costume designer Joseph Porro had set up in Season 1. Aside from wanting to embrace the feminine side of the character, Trpcic says, “She’s been on this journey so she’s tightened up and she’s stronger… We were going to be adding a jetpack, but also she would be doing stunts, and so I wanted it to fit better.” Production designer Doug Chiang had suggested her outfit be inspired by Disney’s 1991 film “The Rocketeer.” So she worked with her painters to find a “beautiful bronze that wasn’t quite the Rocketeer and not quite the Mandalorian,” giving the Amorer a distinct look. She also reduced the size of the helmet, making it more proportionate. Trpcic’s challenge was to create unique details without betraying the clarity of the austere Mandalorian group, including the character Kelleran Beq. Played by Ahmed Best, previously known for playing Jar-Jar Binks, Kelleran was first introduced in 2020’s game show “Star Wars: Jedi Temple Challenge” and the Jedi who saves Grogu (aka Baby Yoda) during the Order 66 attack. Series creator Jon Favreau pointed her to Jewish temples and the scrollwork on the shawls worn by head rabbis. “That was my takeaway. What set him apart was different scrollwork,” she says. “I sketched some out for him. I looked at other Jedi to see what their different leather pieces were.” Trpcic was further inspired by the actor’s own tattoos: “He had all this glorious art, and once he got into the story of it, I did my own research. We incorporated an Afro-futuristic version of that tattoo work into his Jedi robes, which completed his story of redemption from his own walk in life. I got to reinvent a Jedi robe.” Similarly, for Charles Parnell’s survivor captain, Trpcic created a special cross piece after asking him what he’d bring if faced with an apocalypse. “He told me he would grab a photo of his family. Except there are no photographs in ‘Star Wars.’ It became a matter of looking at how such an idea would translate into the ‘Star Wars’ world,” says Trpcic. “I talked with my leather maker, and we contemplated that if you were sitting around a fire and you had a random piece of leather, you would chip out or etch in your family’s portrait. So, we did that, and we put it into his robes. Charles said no one would notice it. I told him, ‘This story is for you, and you can see he’s always holding this beautiful piece next to his heart.’” When it came to creating a look for Lizzo’s cameo as the Duchess of Plazir-15, not only did Trpcic tap back into Disney, but incorporated “a little bit of ‘Alice in Wonderland’ with the tight bodice and full skirt.” Trpcic says she was further inspired by the singer’s “positive and strong energy” and brought that into the look. Trpcic had her crew bead the sleeves and turn the costume around from fitting to screen in three days. “Andor” composer Nicholas Britell (speaking with Variety before the strike) met with LucasFilm’s Kathleen Kennedy and showrunner Tony Gilroy, who knew they wanted a unique musical landscape while keeping in the spirit of “Star Wars.” That brief gave Britell the freedom to try new things. He began by “imagining that this is its own story, and what the sound would be.” The series expands upon Lucas’ ideas, grounding the franchise in the mercenary trade and espionage as Diego Luna’s Cassian goes on a journey from outsider to rebel. With the vast galaxy landscape the show explores, Britell discussed themes with Gilroy. “I remember saying to him, ‘There are so many ways I can orchestrate this. I can do an intimate version.’ And we looked at one another and decided why do we have to choose? We have 12 episodes.” The end result? Britell offers 12 different opening credit themes for the short and simple sequence. “The first thing I wrote was the funeral music for episode 12,” Britell says, referring to Maarva’s (Fiona Shaw) epic farewell in the season finale. He started there for practical reasons; all the on-camera music needed to be ready before shooting started. Through exploration, Britell imagined what the culture of Ferrix (Cassian’s current home) would look and sound like at the end of someone’s life. He says, “I was imagining this tradition and ritual. I wrote this piece that had multiple parts.” The funeral band performed live on set, but that music became what Britell calls a “seed idea.” “Perhaps it’s connected to Marvaa and Cassian’s relationship and how it all ties together. That’s how you start learning about the show,” Britell says. He then created the “time grappler” sound and musical motif and began scoring other scenes. “At the end of episode three, after Syril Karn (Kyle Soller) has failed in his endeavors, you hear the Maarva motif at the end of that sequence, and what will be the funeral music.” He adds, “Our hope was that over the course of the show, and the final of the funeral, we realize that was where the music came from, and that motif defined the whole set up for them.” The same funeral band that performs in Ferrix performs the main credit sequence — “each with a sense of mystery, a touch of melancholy and a rhythmic pulse that become stronger with each version,” says Britell. “There’s a sense of, ‘what does this music around Cassian mean?’ Maybe it’s even something that Cassian doesn’t know yet. Each planet has its own sound. On Morlana, there was this dark, gritty, urban landscape [that demanded] something edgy, textural.” The show’s VFX supervisor, Mohen Leo, was very conscious about fan service when it came to building the world of “Andor” and places like Ferrix, but still made sure it never detracted from the story and character development. The luxury Leo and his team had was the digital backlot, so when they had to build something new or redesign a set or ship, they could lean on what had been done before. “We had 3D models of the spaceships, droids and structures. So, when we put something together, we could go through our toy box.” For Luthen’s (Stellan Skarsgård) escape from the Imperial Forces, he used the Cantwell-Class Arrestor Cruiser from “Solo: A Star Wars Story.” To pull off the sequence, Gilroy gave Leo and Britell the freedom to design the sequence with the idea that the show needed a “space battle moment and inject classic ‘Star Wars’ into it.” Says Leo, “In talking with Tony, one of the inspirations was that Luthen’s ship is what the Aston Martin is to James Bond. It has all these hidden weapons and gadgets so it can pass as a normal freight ship. That became the starting point.” During his escape, he deploys his hidden weapon: a lightsaber-esque laser beam projector that calls back to the famous energy sword. In total, the sequence took six months to put together, from pre-production to post. As for working with real locations versus using ILM’s StageCraft and LED virtual production, it was important that story always came first. Many scenes were shot on location and on fully built sets in the U.K. “Shooting in-camera was important. The scene we shot in Scotland and being in nature, having the physicality of people hiking up a hill made things feel right,” says Leo, noting that unplanned weather also helped serve the storyline. “At the start of episode six on the mountaintop, there’s dense fog. That scene was never designed to be in the fog, but it worked really well.”",

      "text": "“Here, you have the big slice,” Christine Morton insists, reaching over a queenly collection of teacups and saucers to cut into some sort of decadent apricot pastry. The backyard of Morton’s wisteria-drenched West Vancouver home is a scene that wouldn’t look out of place on the front of a luxury spa pamphlet: flowers in varying states of bloom and colour erupting from seemingly everywhere, a white-clothed table topped with golden baked goods, and Morton herself, gracious as ever, pouring tea and slicing treats with the warmth and precision of a seasoned host. To be at Morton’s home, to be in Morton’s vicinity at all, is comforting. To put it simply, the woman knows how to make someone feel good. Not that it should come as much of a surprise, as Morton has been making the fairer sex feel like goddesses for years. Decades, even. Five decades, to be precise. Changing perceptions We’ve come together to discuss a milestone: for 50 years Morton’s silk lingerie and loungewear pieces have been sought after by women across North America and beyond, and some of the planet’s most well-known women at that. Oprah has worn her garments. So has Lauren Bacall, Chrissy Teigen, Gwyneth Paltrow and Elizabeth Taylor. In that time her eponymous label has grown from a basement business in West Vancouver to being stocked in more than 100 high-end boutiques in Canada, the United States, Australia, and the U.K. Timeless pieces that ooze luxury have become her trademark, silk and lace have become synonymous with her name. The brand had been borne from a love of fine materials — a devotion sparked as a child when the designer stumbled across a treasure trove of lace doilies in her grandmother’s dresser — and a simple idea that making garments would be “something fun to do.” Such success was never anticipated, not least in a city where functionality and down-pared style dominate. “The fashion industry was only just beginning in Vancouver at that time,” she says. “I started making teddies, and nobody had ever heard of teddies before. At that time, 50 years ago, a camisole wasn’t even a name. You never saw any advertisements in the magazines for anything other than a bra and panty, and even then they were…” the Scottish-born, Vancouver-raised designer trails off, evidently struggling to find a polite term for the drab and function-forward underwear of the 70s. Shifting the public’s perception of lingerie from function to fashion was a bold undertaking, but audacity would go on to be the reason behind much of her brand’s success. It was certainly the reason behind her Stateside triumph. “The first sales trip I made to New York I had been by myself. I phoned up the stores when I got there, I made the appointments on the spot, and I managed to get them. It was amazing.” Bergdorf Goodman, Bloomingdales, Saks and Henri Bendel “went crazy” for her collection, comprising just five or so little camisoles with Morton’s trademark rosebuds, detailing she had learned to make in her very first job as a gift wrapper. Several placed orders immediately. Soon the windows were stocked and the magazines came calling, Women’s Wear Daily first, Glamour, Town & Country, Marie Claire, Elle, GQ and InStyle later. Hollywood’s elite, feverish as ever to snatch up the latest trends touted by the glossies, were hot on her heels. The likes of Cher, Linda Evans, and Joan Collins joined Bacall and Taylor in becoming high-profile, long-time fans. “Walking down Fifth Avenue and seeing a whole window of all your whimsical wraps, and all your pieces, that’s just a treat,” the designer says. “There have been moments like that where you go, ‘Oh, I’m doing something right here.” High calibre clientele She credits her high-calibre celebrity clientele as being further confirmation of knowing she’s “doing something right,” and some of her most defining career milestones have been dressing A-Listers. “I received a call from an unknown buyer who just said ‘I hope you’ve got some lavender in stock.’ I asked why, and she replied, ‘Well, Oprah’s wearing your pyjamas on the front cover of her magazine.'\" Morton's face widens in surprise, even now, as she retells the story. There was one gown so beloved by Elizabeth Taylor that she would ask for it to be shipped to her apartment in New York in every colour. (“She’s just very little, so we had to cut it about five inches off the bottom.”) It’s now dubbed the \"Liz gown,\" naturally. Acquiring such a steadfast fandom in the fashion world often means creating something so entirely unique and utterly timeless that the wearer will keep returning again and again no matter the season or in-vogue style. Following trends, says Morton, has never been a matter of great importance. Instead, the designer says she would rather create something that can be worn endlessly by women, before being passed down to their children, as time-honoured heirlooms. “She has a really strong, beautiful esthetic, and that has never shifted far away from where it started,” explains Morton’s assistant designer Evan Clayton, when asked about the reason behind Christine’s unremitting success. “That is part of the core of designing for Christine, the person that is wearing the clothes isn’t this nebulous concept. It’s an actual person.\" Clayton, who has been working under Morton’s guidance for five years, says there is a “real, interpersonal connection” between the designer and her clients, women have grown up in tandem with the brand. Dedicated to the brand Perhaps the biggest indication of the timelessness and quality of the designs is that Morton is most often found donning them herself. At home in her garden she sits draped in a vibrant silk kimono. A few weeks later when we meet for a tour of her store and studio, located on Powell Street in Vancouver, she floats from room to room in a similar silk creation, this time in a vivid green hue. Even at her wedding in 1983, to the now late David Farris, she walked down the aisle in one of her own pieces. Her first foray into bridal wear, Morton had designed her own gown and the Edwardian-inspired dresses for her flower girl and three bridesmaids. It is also an example of the many ways in which Morton’s personal and professional lives overlapped. When you are a brand’s own producer, designer, marketing manager and events planner for so many years – “when you have your own business, and you’re an entrepreneur, you have to wear all the hats” – it is easy for lines to become blurred, she says. Those blurred lines are evident further still in Morton’s studio, where the ever-loyal staff have become very much like a family of her own. In 1983 Morton sponsored several seamstresses from Laos enabling them to live and work in Vancouver, many of whom brought their growing families with them. “As I’ve progressed through the years it has really become about this cottage industry for me,” she explains. “That was really key, and really important, because it meant the girls were able to work from home and have their babies and have a family, but also have a job,” she says, describing how the privilege of running her own business meant she had been able to do the same – not sacrificing a career for a family or vice-versa – and that, above all the glamorous magazine nods and celebrity adoration, had been the most momentous of career highlights. The future of Christine Morton, a grandmother herself now, said her small-scale team is intrinsic to the design process, but that doesn’t mean she’s ready to pass on the baton just yet. “There are so many things happening right now, I’d like to see us grow myself,” she says, touching on how the brand recently made its first foray into menswear, and, just this year, it released its Black Label Collection – a limited quantity of up-and-coming designs that would be released just once, each month. Celebration-wise, a 50th birthday bash is due to be held at West Vancouver lingerie store Romantique on the afternoon of Sept. 16 (“We are hoping people might wear their favourite Christine pieces,” says Morton with a smile), while a Limited Edition 50th Anniversary Collection draws inspiration from the label’s most iconic pieces from the past five decades. Long-time lovers of Christine can expect glistening pink peignoir sets and a voluminous nightshirt that has been a firm favourite since it was originally introduced in the 1980s. ‘If it ain’t broke don’t fix it’ is the brand’s guiding philosophy after all, why change now?

      "title": "Day in the life of tattoo artist - blackout trend, £800 daily fee and one-year wait",
      "text": "As a self-proclaimed 'tattoo virgin', just the mere thought of walking into No Regrets tattoo studio was somewhat intimidating to me - despite the fact I wasn't even planning to get a tat. I'd been invited to tag along with a tattoo artist for the day, and I had some pretty stereotypical expectations - picturing a dark and dingy shop with hardcore men inked from head to toe. But the stylish and contemporary studio on vibrant Stokes Croft in Bristol couldn't have been more different, with its industrial interiors and laidback atmosphere instantly calming. Walking up to the front desk, I'm greeted by manager Rosie Howard Williams, who turns on the coffee machine and talks me through what a modern-day tattoo studio actually looks like. \"Old-school tattoo shops used to put people off; they were very agro. If you didn't want five men working on you at the same time without breaks, then you weren't a tattoo person,\" she explains. \"But tattoos are for everyone now, in a way they weren't 10 years ago. \"You get your high-street trade and street shops, where you can choose a design out of a book, and custom studios like this, where everything is bespoke. We have 19 industry leaders from around the world here, both male and female, and each of them specialise in something different.\" Rosie tells me that tattoos are more accepted in society these days and there are all sorts of new trends emerging. \"Microrealism is very popular,\" she says, showing me photos of mind-blowing 3D tats, adding, \"and cybersigilism has been a growing trend in the last couple of years\". Those have a futuristic feel. \"Fine art and illustrative tattoos are also pretty popular and tribal is coming back into style, just in a different way,\" Rosie says. I ask her about blackout tattoos and she explains that \"most people get them because they've got something big that can't be covered up, like neotribal\". \"We had one guy recently who had a blackout palm. It must have been so painful,\" she says, adding that it would be near-impossible to cover them, \"so I don't know what people will do when they go out of style\". She tells me that the sternum, knees, armpits, elbows and inner upper arms at the most sensitive spots, but the palms are the worst. Having never been inked before, I ask the question that she's likely answered a million times: Do tattoos hurt? And she tells me: \"They do hurt. There's no two ways about it.\" As lots of people begin to file into the studio and meet and greet their artists, I spot a few nervous faces, but most clients are relaxed. \"We can find space for you to have one later,\" Rosie suggests casually, and I slightly panic inside. Could today be the day I get my first tattoo? \"I'll have a think about it,\" I tell her. We take a tour upstairs, to the open and bright space where dozens of pristine stools and beds are lined up ready for the day. I learn that a laser technician shares the building, but most customers have cover-ups instead of removals. \"Some people aren't keen on really big tribal print anymore, and anything nineties is out of style now,\" Rosie says. Then she introduces me to the guy I'll be shadowing - Mihai Turuianu - who goes in for a friendly hug instead of a handshake and I immediately feel welcomed. He's a really lovely and unique character and I'm fascinated to get to know him. \"Mihai is really an artist, not a traditional tattooist. His art is very atmospheric and unusual,\" Rosie says. \"He has to tell a story and he won't take on a project without meaning behind it.\" Mihai tells me that he was born in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, and has travelled around Europe for a decade to learn about different forms of art. \"The first time I put a needle to skin was around 10 years ago. It was kind of a joke and I started tattooing friends. After a few years, I realised I could become better by learning the art and how to draw,\" he says. Mihai is self-taught and he's incredibly popular with tattoo lovers, who will travel as far as Germany and wait over a year to secure a one-to-one appointment with him. In fact, I'm shocked to hear that his next available slot is July 2024. \"I work with one guy per day for a full session. This is my first time tattooing Imani,\" Mihai explains, introducing me to his client. Imani Saidy is 23 years old and has travelled from Swindon, after booking an appointment all the way back in January 2022. \"A friend of mine from Northern Ireland recommend Mihai to me,\" he explains. Imani's already got six tattoos, including burning roses on his forearm and the 10 Commandments on his wrist - and today he'll be filling in his left sleeve. But to my complete surprise, Imani has absolutely no idea what tattoo he'll be getting permanently inked today - despite having more than a year to think about it and it taking up half of his limb. \"I've never had an experience like this before. Usually, I give the artist a design, but this time I had no clue. Mihai designed it for me,\" he explains. Imani met with Mihai once before, and they spoke about his life in the Army and his introverted personality, and then Imani gave him the freedom to create a piece. The tattoo is a beautiful black and white portrait of a woman with the word 'chaos' written above it. \"It looks naughty,\" Imani says impressed. \"You got me bang on. I can be quite quiet and seem composed, but on the inside, there's lots of chaos,\" Imani describes, and Mihai looks really pleased. He explains: \"For me, it's all about feelings. I don't sell a product. We create a collaborative piece of art. It's not a printer job.\" For the next hour, Mihai gets to work laying out the materials and tools that he'll need, making 'secret' ink mixtures. He shows me the dozens of tattoos he's got on his body, from seven artists, and the very first tat he did on himself. \"It's a very bad one. It's supposed to be a panther with human legs and arms. It's a beautiful memory,\" he explains. \"When I really like a tattoo artist, I collect a piece of their art, like paintings.\" In a typical day, Mihai will start work at 11am and go home whenever he finishes his tattoo, which could be 6pm or as late as 10pm. \"I charge everyone £800 for a day session, no matter what you want,\" he explains. \"I love to take my time and make people feel comfortable. I prefer to take breaks when I like. It's a healthy way to work without pressure.\" While £800 sounds like a lot, I soon learn why there's a general misconception that tats are mega expensive. \"From the outside, people think we make a lot of money, but there are so many things we pay for,\" Mihai says, explaining that it costs him approximately £5,000 a month for materials, training courses, his website, Instagram ads and the top-rated equipment, as well as going to conventions to advertise his art. \"A lot of work goes into each tattoo. I usually work eight-hour days, three to five times a week, and spend weekends creating designs. A tattoo takes around 12 hours to prepare,\" he explains. As Imani lays down on the bed and Mihai gets to work inking, starting at the bottom of his arm (so as not to rub out the stencil), I watch with intrigue. \"My style is different from what you find commercially - either you really love it or you really hate it,\" Mihai says. He really is the Marmite of the tattoo world, with a unique and abstract style that only works on big designs. I discover that Mihai chooses his clients in the same way they select him. \"If I don't find common ground with a person, I just refuse them. I wouldn't do a tattoo if there wasn't a story,\" he explains. As well as the style and backstory, Mihai won't work on somebody's face or neck. \"I have refused to tattoo a lot of places on the body. I don't like the neck because it's not a big canvas and it's rare for someone to have good skin on their neck,\" he explains. \"It's very elastic so you have to stretch it a lot. I think the face is one of the most beautiful parts of the body and it's a piece of art in itself, so I don't want to be a part of that. I don't have a problem with artists who do, or people that have them, I just choose not to.\" He tells me that arms are his favourite body part as \"the shape is nice and they have huge potential\". Mihai continues to shade each section of the tattoo while chatting away, and after a couple of hours, I can see the woman coming to life. At 3pm, he takes a quick break to go outside and refuel, and it's also a chance for Imani to stretch his legs and have another coffee, before returning with headphones and music to distract him from the pain. \"It is painful, but so is having a baby,\" Mihai light-heartedly says. \"If your nerves are very close to the skin, it can be extremely painful. I had one guy who screamed really bad and I felt terrible, but he told me, 'I don't want you to stop', so I learnt to ignore it.\" I take a glance at Imani and I can tell he feels thankful that it's not that agonising for him. As the end of the shift nears, I'm interested to hear about the maintenance of a tattoo and what goes into the aftercare. \"Generally, a tattoo takes around a week and a half to heal,\" Mihai says. \"It's good to take two days off before and after the session. Before, you should moisturise the area with cream and take some vitamins. Don't drink alcohol as it can increase your blood pressure, or tan as sunburn can make it more sensitive. \"Tattoos need 24 hours to stabilise so it's very important to have the same environment close to the cells. After three days, you can expose the tattoo to the outside world.\" I learn that tattoos will heal much quicker and easier than piercings if you really take care of them, and swimming immediately after should be avoided. As all of the artists around us finish up with their tattoos for the day, the studio gets a little quieter and my opportunity to get inked comes around. \"Are you sure you don't want one?\" Rosie asks, trying to persuade me - but I decide to stick to my bare skin for now. I'd be far more interested in picking up the pen and inking somebody else, though Mihai understandably won't let me in on the action. \"A lot of people think anybody can be a tattoo artist but that's not true,\" he explains. Having a closer look at Imani's almost-finished design, I can see why Mihai refers to every piece of his work as a 'masterpiece', because it really is one. His art is one-of-a-kind, and he couldn't be further from the stereotype I pictured. As a tattoo outsider, I've learnt that the modern-day world of tats really isn't what it used to be.",

      "title": "20 pre-Columbian artifacts repatriated to Mexico from Belgium",
      "text": "Mexico has received word from an overseas diplomat that 20 archaeological pieces — some perhaps more than 1,500 years old — have been handed over to the country by a private citizen in Belgium. The pieces were delivered to Rogelio Granguillhome Morfín, the Mexican ambassador to Belgium, by a Belgian woman named Louise Du Moulin Maria, who noted that her family had been in possession of the Mexican assets for more than 70 years. In announcing the news this week, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) explained that specialists examined the objects and determined that they were made in the Mesoamerican Classic period (A.D. 100-650) by cultures in the Central Highlands, an area that includes what is now Mexico City. The items will be further inspected after they arrive in Mexico. INAH noted in a press release that the Mexican embassy in Belgium “will continue to contribute to the priority work of returning Mexico’s historical heritage” through the #MiPatrimonioNoSeVende (My Heritage is Not for Sale) campaign. Launched in 2018, the initiative seeks to prevent the sale of Mexico’s archaeological and historical assets and promote their recovery and return to their place of origin. Du Moulin said it was thanks to the #MiPatrimonioNoSeVende campaign that she became aware that her family’s objects “belong to Mexico.”For his part, Granguillhome thanked Du Moulin and her family for their willingness to give to Mexico “what belongs to it as part of its historical and cultural heritage.” He also pointed to a “context of good relations” between Mexico and Belgium. According to INAH, the appearance of archaeological pieces abroad is presumed to be the product of looting, plunder or a chain of illegal acts, and such pieces thus merit being returned to Mexico. According to the news source Infobae, Mexico has recovered more than 11,500 pieces it considers national heritage during the administration of President López Obrador, who took office in 2018. AMLO’s government has targeted auction houses in New York, Paris, Rome and elsewhere when objects that appear to be part of Mexico’s patrimony are put up for auction. Moreover, Mexico’s demands that foreign governments recover archaeological and artistic pieces have intensified. These efforts have paid off. Late last year, more than 50 objects were handed over voluntarily by citizens of Austria, Canada, Sweden and the United States. Then in March of this year, 83 ancient artifacts were returned to Mexico from Italy, Germany and France. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that a massive Olmec structure would be repatriated to Mexico from the U.S after reportedly being stolen in the late 1950s. Known as Chalcatzingo Monument 9 or the “Portal to the Underworld,” the monument is reported to be six and a half feet meters tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds; it was flown home on a Mexican Air Force plane. “The approximately 2,500-year-old monument was for decades Mexico’s number one priority in terms of recovering its historical heritage,” the Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement at the time.

      "title": "Safety, finances top of mind for new Metro Transit general manager | MinnPost",
      "text": "The Met Council has selected a new general manager of Metro Transit, an 11-year-employee named Lesley Kandaras. Kandaras, 43, replaces retiring Wes Kooistra, for whom she served as chief of staff before being appointed to the top spot last week. She is the first woman to head the regional transit agency since its creation in 1967. The seven-county transit service has a $530 million annual budget and is in the midst of a six-year, $2.57 billion capital improvement project that received a significant boost during the 2023 legislation session. The state transportation budget contained a new 0.75% sales tax in the seven-county region that will raise $766 million in the first two years, $973 million in the second two years. The Met Council will receive 83% of that for transit. The new money will both solve an impending deficit and allow for a major system expansion, including extensions of the Green Line and Blue Line light rail routes and new bus rapid transit lines. They include the E Line from Southdale to the University of Minnesota via Uptown, Hennepin Avenue and University Avenue, the B Line along Lake Street to downtown St. Paul and the Purple Line from downtown St. Paul to White Bear Lake. The challenges facing the new general manager include ridership that is recovering but is still not back to pre-pandemic levels, increased crime and disruption on transit and a shortage of both transit operators and transit police. This Q&A has been lightly edited for length and clarity. MinnPost: How did you get to Minnesota from Rapid City, South Dakota? Lesley Kandaras: I initially came to the Twin Cities to go to college at Hamline University. And then after graduating from there, I was gone for several years. I went to graduate school in Chicago. I worked for a member of Congress, first in South Dakota, and then in D.C. And then in 2009 I moved back here and worked briefly for Sen. Klobuchar’s office, and then started at the council in 2012. MP: Your first job at the council was a policy job? LK: The title was Senior Project Coordinator, and it was in communications working closely with (director of government relations) Judd Shetnan. It was really kind of a miscellaneous portfolio of work ranging from supporting the chair and council members on their public presentations to managing projects within the organization. It was really an opportunity to learn the whole gamut of the council's work. MP: You've been with the agency for a little over a decade, but you're not a transit lifer. LK: No. I've ridden transit throughout most of my life, but 2019 was the first time I worked over here. MP: You certainly come in with fresh eyes, but what are the downsides of not having been a transit person this whole time? LK: First off, one of the reasons I love working here is I learn something new every day. Transit is a multifaceted organization, and certainly it provides me a lot of opportunity to go out and spend time in the garages with our maintenance folks, with our police department, to really see the agency through multiple perspectives. But my background is much more in that policy communications realm. My first introduction to transit when I worked at the Metropolitan Council was really helping to build the case for continued investment in transit. I learned a lot through that angle too. But I am still learning, and it is hopefully bringing a fresh perspective. That means I have a lot of opportunities to get to know this work better. MP: Have you ever driven a bus, even around the yard? LK: No, I haven’t. MP: Do you have to be in the union? LK: That's a good question. I want to drive a bus. I mean, that's kind of on my list of things I’d like to personally experience, but no, I haven't yet. MP: Many if not all transit agencies have had a tough three, four years. The pandemic, its aftermath, the murder of George Floyd. You have a police agency. Given those challenges, why'd you want this job? LK: I'm actually really excited about this role precisely because we're at a really pivotal time, certainly emerging from the pandemic and, here in the Twin Cities, the murder of George Floyd, the civil unrest that followed. It's been a really tumultuous few years. I think right now we're seeing ridership continue to grow, and we're in the process of really trying to connect with our customers to learn how their needs and values — as it relates to transit — have changed. So, I think it's a really interesting time to be in transit, to really chart out that future and really develop a vision for how we can best serve our region through transit. But also it's a unique time given the Legislature's investment in transit as well. We're in a good position, better than many other transit agencies are in terms of now having a sustainable source of funding as our COVID federal relief dollars run out. MP: When you say “interesting,” do you mean interesting, interesting. Or Minnesota Interesting? LK: I would say for me, and even going back to when I started at the council, I feel that transit really has potential to improve people's lives and strengthen communities. That really attracts me as an opportunity here to really look at transit, not only as a mode of transportation, but also as a way to really improve our communities. So that's what I meant by interesting. MP: You're a transit user. What routes do you use? LK: I use the 9 quite a bit to get to work. That's the one closest to my house. I also walk to the Lake Street/Midtown Station quite a bit to use the light rail. I use the 21, I use the 94. My husband and I share a car, and that works because I take transit a lot. It's not my only means of transportation, but it's certainly a big part of it. MP: Have you felt safe on vehicles and in stations? LK: I have personally felt safe, but I don't always feel comfortable. And I certainly have heard from customers who don't feel safe, and I believe those experiences and know we need to do more to ensure all our customers feel safe. I think certainly addressing our public safety challenges is a very high priority. MP: The agency had its own public safety plan prior to the Legislature acting. But the (Rep. Brad) Tabke program came in, starting June 1. I know we're gonna get an update later this week. But can you give me some sense of how you think that has been going and where you are with it? LK: For some background on me, part of my role was facilitating the creation of our safety and security action plan. And one of the principles behind that is it's really an all-hands-on-deck effort here at Metro Transit. What I mean by that is, it's not only about what our police are doing, it's also about how we're maintaining our facilities, how we're operating our bus and rail system, how we're communicating with customers to make sure they understand what our code of conduct is and what expectations are. So the safety and security action plan was really meant to be this document that captured the multitude of ways that we're trying to improve conditions on our system, many of which have to do with: How do we increase presence on our system? I think the Tabke legislation, the Transit Rider Investment Program in particular, will be an additional tool as we try to expand our official presence on our system. So part of what we'll share (Wednesday) night (during a presentation to the Met Council) is, we're in the process of working to set up the Transit Rider Investment Program that will hire non-sworn, non-police employees. They'll be responsible for routine fare compliance now that we also have the administrative citations authority, which is another piece we're actively setting up. In addition to fare compliance, they're going to be interacting with customers providing transit information, connecting customers, who may be in need, to services. They'll have the ability to contact our police department if they need additional assistance out there. So I think the legislation that passed was very much in line with the direction we were heading, but certainly creates a clear structure for where we'll take that next. MP: The Met Council is charged with updating the rider code of conduct. Has that happened yet? LK: Metro Transit has long had a code of conduct and what the Omnibus transportation bill did this year is it now requires us to have one and has some language in there about how we display it and so forth. Even before the omnibus passed, we had staff really taking a look, not just on what the code of conduct says, but how do we uphold it, and really trying to understand the different roles and responsibilities. So these aren't just words on a sign, but we actually are setting positive standards for the use of the shared public space that is transit. We had a survey to get some feedback from customers to get a sense of rules and standards they're really interested in seeing. That's a long way of saying, I don't want the perception to be, we have no code of conduct. But we're in the process of formalizing it, per the requirements of the legislation. MP: There has been criticism from riders and legislators that Metro Transit and Metro Transit Police stood down to some degree during COVID and weren't enforcing the codes that you have and the ordinances that you have. Is that a legitimate perception? And were there mistakes made during COVID that now you're trying to undo? LK: I'll say two things about that. One, certainly in the immediate aftermath of the stay-at-home orders, we were quickly adjusting to that new reality. I think across all of our operations, including police, we were looking at ways to keep customers and employees safe. So that was a time we were actively telling people don't ride transit unless you need it to get somewhere. We started rear door boarding until we were at a point we could have protection around all of our drivers. I don't know the ins and outs of how police protocol changed during that time, but I am sure they were grappling with how to minimize contact between employees and customers. But another piece that I think is what's making this more visible is our police workforce has really declined in recent years. So we're down to about 107 officers of the 171 full-time positions we have in our budget. Our police department is not alone in losing police officers in recent years and is actively competing with many other law enforcement departments to build back the department. But I think what people are seeing is we are a smaller police force at the time. We continue to grow our proof of payment system so I think that is becoming visible to people. And I'll just add, that's why part of the focus of the safety and Security Action plan is increasing official presence. That isn't only about officers. It's contracting with community-based organizations. For instance, we have an organization called a Mother's Love that goes out and interacts with customers. We've started supplemental security at some of our most highly used transit facilities, again, to provide more presence there. So even though we don't have our police workforce numbers where we need them to be, we're actively looking at ways to have other presence and certainly that Transit Rider Investment Program personnel. Hopefully once we get that up and running, there’ll be another set of eyes and ears. MP: The signs say I have to have a paid fare to be on the platform. Is that enforced? LK: The police department right now is out educating customers, checking fares. Whether they're doing it on trains or platforms, that's a good question for the chief. But that's part of where the Transit Rider Investment Program comes in. I think it will really be a good innovation for us because as we bring in these new non-sworn personnel who are going to be doing fare compliance, it'll provide us more opportunities to figure out what’s the most strategic way to do that. MP: Are you seeing results from riders resulting from the increased presence that you are referencing? LK: I would say where we have supplemental security, we are receiving some positive feedback. So right now at Lake Street-Midtown Blue Line Station we have supplemental security there and we are receiving feedback both from customers and employees that that's really helped make some improvements there. I think the lesson we're learning is when you have consistent presence, it does make a difference. The challenge then becomes having the workforce to do that. Right now it's Franklin and Lake Street Midtown. We’re looking to expand it, potentially in the next week or so, to the 35W Lake Street Station as well as Brooklyn Center Transit Center. MP: There is a new fare-free pilot program, is there not? LK: Part of the transportation omnibus was a fare-free pilot for two regular route bus routes. The council selected Route 62 and Route 32. That started on July 1st, and that'll last 18 months. And we report back to the Legislature about what we've learned from that. MP: From what you know from other agencies that have tried it, what's the result? What do you get out of it? LK: The hope is it will entice more people to take more trips on transit. So we'll be watching closely what it does to ridership on those routes. I think there's a potential for there to be a benefit of time savings. If you don't have people paying when they get on board, we're going to be looking to see if that improves travel times on those routes. Also it's reducing a potential point of conflict between operators and passengers who don't want to pay. I think some other agencies have seen it as a way to just avoid that interaction around fares generally. MP: Is there also the potential … of having those routes be routes that people just ride all day? Because they don't have to pay, it sort of becomes a rolling shelter for those routes. LK: I think the result on passenger behavior will be another piece of what we're gonna want to look at and how can we ensure that it remains a source of transportation for people. MP: You can't rebuild ridership if there are no trains and buses running. And you can't run trains and buses if you don't have operators. So what are you doing to try to tackle that problem? LK: A big part of what I want to focus on is how we ensure that Metro Transit becomes an employer of choice for people in our region. Transit is driven by people — literally. In order to provide service, we need to have a workforce that can provide it. So some of what we've already been working on is looking not just at our recruitment strategies, we've been doing some innovative things such as going out into community, really trying to have our current workforce build relationships with others and make it a place where people can see that, you know, great people work here, come join us. But some of it, too, is on the retention front and making sure that we're providing the training, the mentorship and support for our workforce. So they want to stay here and they want to grow their career here. Workforce is how we can build back service. The fast frequent all day service, that's really going to be key to rebuilding ridership. I think that's really where a lot of the focus is right now. We want to be providing more service than we can because of our workforce levels. In our budget we have room to grow the workforce. It's a matter of recruiting and retaining the people we need to provide that service. Metro TransitClick on the above graphic to view a PDF version of the Future Rapid Transit Network.MP: You are at 15-minute headways (on light rail) right now. When can you get back to 10 minutes? LK: It'll depend on the operator hiring. One change that happened last year is we came to an agreement with the (Amalgamated Transit Union) to allow us to hire (light rail) train operators directly. Previously, you had to be a bus operator before you could be a train operator. So we're still in the somewhat early stages of hiring train operators directly. But we're hopeful that will help us get our train operator workforce up. I think the idea is we think there might be people out there who'd be interested in operating a light rail vehicle and might not view themselves as wanting to be a bus operator. It's one more tool. I would say it's not meant to be the panacea, but we're trying any new idea we can to see what we can do to continue to build the workforce. MP: You had a great session, both some direct appropriations and then the transit sales tax, a more-than-decent source of money for both operations and expansion. What does that open up, do you think, for the agency over the six year plan and beyond that? LK: We're going from a time where we were really focused on making the case for transit investment to now needing to shift and show people the return on that investment. And so part of what we're doing this summer is really analyzing what that new revenue means. I think in addition to it being new revenue, it's also addressing longstanding needs we have. So this gets a little complicated, but the COVID federal relief was one-time money. So that pushed out the time we were going to hit our fiscal cliff. But starting in the next biennium, 2026-27, we projected that we were going to hit our deficit. So the sales tax is coming at a great time to really give us some stability and allow us to plan ahead knowing we have ongoing sources of funding. That's a piece of it, just addressing this long standing fiscal cliff concern. Another piece of what the transportation bill did is it shifted the counties’ obligation for operations for rail to the sales tax. The sales tax will be picking that up. We are responsible for the capital maintenance of those guideways. But all of that aside, it's clearly an opportunity to be really bold about what transit system does our region want. And I think part of what we're looking at doing is ensuring we're really engaging our customers, engaging the community and listening to where there are opportunities to invest and really provide that return on investment given the significant new source of revenue.",

Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions. So we drove out to the Midwest for vacation. And so I was like, oh, we’ll just audiobook it. And between the drive back and forth, I barely had covered half of the book because it was like 27 hours or something ridiculous. Wait, you subjected your family to the “Oppenheimer” audiobook? They loved it. Or they lied to me. Either way. Well, I mean, I read it when it came out. It’s like 17 years ago, so I mean, I don’t remember. So once wasn’t enough. I just remember that it was great. Nerd. Uh-huh. So I had to read it again. Right, sure. Nerd! [MUSIC PLAYING] From New York Times Opinion, I’m Ross Douthat. I’m Michelle Cottle. I’m Carlos Lozada. And I’m Lydia Polgreen. And this is “Matter of Opinion.” So last week, Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” came out, and all four of us saw it. Not together. Not together, except in spirit, but so did a lot of other people. The movie has already made more than 80 million bucks at the box office. Now, if you haven’t seen it, I don’t know that anything we’ll discuss is the biggest spoiler, given that the movie is based on extremely famous historical events, but we probably shouldn’t promise not to have any spoilers, right? Spoiler, the good guys won World War II. Oh, well, that itself is a controversial statement, Carlos, but we’ll be talking about whether the movie is really about the good guys, what its moral vision is, what it says about when politics and potentially world ending science collide. But we’ll start with the basics. What did everybody think about the movie? Silence. Come on, come on. What did you — let’s hear it. I’m going to jump in. Fun family fair. I’m going to jump in. I thought the movie was spectacular. It’s obviously going to generate some controversy about whether they were too soft on communism or made Oppenheimer too much of a hero, but it was ambitious. It was, of course, gorgeous. There were some weirder moments in it that are kind of Christopher Nolan’s forte, but on the whole, it took what was a sweeping, huge book, “American Prometheus.” It won the Pulitzer. It is well worth a read and really gives it a good narrative that drives you through what is an unacceptable three hours. No movie should be three hours. But this one was good enough that I didn’t start to fidget like a four-year-old until about 2 and 1/2 hours in, which is always a good sign. Carlos, what did you think? I really enjoyed it. I wasn’t as troubled by the length because it sort of tells two stories. It tells the story of the race to design and test the atom bomb. And then it tells the story of how Oppenheimer was sort of cast aside by the very government that had deployed him for war-making purposes when he was no longer useful, when he became kind of an irritant. And I mean, those stories are woven together in the movie. So to me, since there was so much that was worth getting into, I wasn’t troubled by the length. I didn’t think it was too long at all. I love a biopic. I love an epic book. I love an epic movie. I mean, the performances, I thought, were incredible. And I have to say, I was astonished by the box office numbers that so many people wanted to see this movie because I think most people who go to the movies during summer blockbuster season aren’t necessarily looking to be challenged in this way. But yeah, I found myself quite swept up with it. Yeah, so the box office was remarkable. And since one of my big things is the decline and fall of the American movies and so on, I feel churlish saying anything negative about “Oppenheimer” because it is terrific that it did so well. And Nolan is terrific, and the cast was terrific. I wasn’t sure about the last hour of the movie. So it does this sort of — there’s sort of the central forward momentum narrative carrying you through the Manhattan Project, culminating in the big explosion, right, which comes about 2/3 of the way through the movie. And then there’s the aftermath in the 1950s, which takes two forms. You follow both Oppenheimer through the sort of closed, unfair kangaroo court hearing where he loses his security clearance over his various ties to the many communists who were associated with his social and intellectual world in the 1930 and ‘40s. And then you also get the failed nomination to Dwight Eisenhower’s cabinet of Lewis Strauss, played by Robert Downey, Jr., in a really terrific performance. Strauss was a Republican hawk, and Oppenheimer famously became a critic of arms race politics. But so the movie is sort of culminating in Lewis Strauss not getting the Secretary of Commerceship. And you can see what Nolan is doing here, but honestly, to me, there was just a pretty big gap between the drama of the literal atomic bomb and the drama of Lewis Strauss’s cabinet nomination. And in the end, I felt like that was an artistic failure. I totally get your point, but in a blockbuster movie, you have to have a villain. And who are we going to make the villain in a movie like this? It’s a very complicated, weird subject. And you had to have an antagonist for Oppenheimer. I actually disagree, and I think it’s actually a fascinating artistic choice because watching this movie, I thought, so much of it takes place in kind of the perfect setting for a film that is, in a lot of ways, about the professional managerial class. These dramas take place in these incredibly claustrophobic, bureaucratic, drab meeting rooms. And the only reason that you know that this is an incredibly important proceeding is that you have this assaultive score that’s coming at you with these incredible strings playing. And I think that there is this symmetry that feels very real to me. I guess it’s a metaphorical symmetry between the very real destruction of the atomic bomb and the very real power of personal grudges and spite between members of the professional managerial class over petty politics and power. So to me, that felt like a central tension and storyline of the entire movie. I agree that that’s a critical element of this story. And in some ways, just as dramatic as the race to develop the bomb, you can imagine the movie focusing on the Trinity test and then on Oppenheimer’s transformation, and sort of an activist against the H-bomb worrying about what he had unleashed. But the story is about how the government turns against him, how it found him dangerous. And something kind of remarkable is that I don’t know if you all saw the story, but just like last December of this past year, the Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm, finally nullified the commission’s revoking of Oppenheimer’s security clearance, saying that it had been, as more information came out about what the hearing had been like and the unfairness of the process, that they just couldn’t stand by it. I like the fact that the book and the movie really drive home how confusing a political time this was. So like well before the bomb or the hearings, you had this whole concern about, on the one hand, the Nazis, and this is the major race you’re fighting off. But even before Oppenheimer was drafted for this project, just like so much churn about communism. And so you had these two competing tensions, and he almost didn’t wind up in charge of the project because of his relationships. I think people forget what just kind of a weird global time that was. And this does a really good job of just trying to drive home how much cloud there was around everything. Yeah, well, I mean, it feels weird to say this with a three-hour movie, but you’re struck by all the things that they kind of had to leave out. You see how, in the movie, he’s this kind of immediately charismatic professor at Berkeley, right? It starts with one student, and then suddenly it’s packed because he’s so captivating. He was actually a terrible teacher initially. He was unintelligible. He taught himself slowly to become a better teacher. And that cult of Oppie kind of grew up around him. What Michelle mentions about the ferment of the moment is sort of even more alive in the book, even around physics. The movie kind of glosses over this because you don’t want to spend too much time on it, besides like, oh, look at all these cool formulas on a chalkboard, you know? But his genius was in helping others crystallize the ideas that they would pursue. And there’s a moment in the movie when I think the Matt Damon character, Groves, asks him, why he hasn’t won a Nobel Prize yet? Because everyone around him had Nobel’s. It’s super stressful when you’re like the one guy with no Nobel. Tell me about it. And it’s that the Nobel’s were awarded for super specific, deep contributions to a particular field. And Oppenheimer was kind of interested in everything. He was too distracted for that. He was a great enabler and crystallizer of other people’s ideas. I think one of the interesting things about that particular moment in physics and science, right, is that prior to World War II, prior to the Manhattan Project, there was still a way in which science was operating outside of what we now think of as kind of the American university model. It was much more European. There’s a really strong aristocratic vibe. And Oppenheimer himself is much — he’s rich, right? He’s a rich kid. I’m not sure this is completely, completely conveyed in the movie, though it’s clear that he’s vacationing in New Mexico. Yeah, he basically puts the Manhattan Project where he likes to go for vacation, right? It would be like, if you were like, well, I really like this little town on the coast of Maine. Let’s build the atomic bomb there. And there are a couple local lobster fishermen, but they won’t object. I guess I wonder what, as the resident reactionary, I thought the movie up till the sort of final 30 minutes was actually quite effective in making a case that maybe Oppenheimer, once the project was over, shouldn’t have a security clearance. I mean, I think the movie does a good job of portraying Oppenheimer as a very complicated, fairly unstable figure, someone who literally poisoned the apple of his professor while in graduate school, someone who was friends with tons of communists, ran a program that was successfully infiltrated by communists, apparently only had sex with either communists or ex-communists. His brother was a communist, don’t forget. His brother is a communist. The question is, should he have this security clearance? And the moment when Leslie Groves, played really well, as always, by Matt Damon, testifies and is asked based on the current Cold War era security guidelines, would Oppenheimer pass muster, and he has to say no, I mean, he’s right, isn’t he? Yeah. Although I thought the line was great because he said, no, but under the current system, I’m not sure I would have cleared any of these guys, which kind of gets to the period where scientists didn’t automatically going to think of themselves as extensions of the political argument. But it gets to the period where under the circumstances of a war against national socialism and imperial Japan, you have to say, yeah, if the best scientists are sort of compromised by associations with communism, it doesn’t matter. You have to have them in there. But then, once you’re in a Cold War environment with Soviet Russia, you probably wouldn’t run the Manhattan Project the same way. I think that’s right, but I think that there’s also, to your point, Ross, there’s a sort of a noblesse oblige around Oppenheimer. And that, I think, goes hand in hand with another big theme of the book and the movie, which is his kind of naivete. You see him floating in this world of ideas and theory and communism and the Spanish Civil War as a romantic cause. And all of those things are true. But they’re all taking place in an environment that’s outside of hard politics and more in the realm of the theoretical. And I think that what you’re seeing in the film is this, and actually in history, is this move towards a much harder and more concrete reality in which the people in this world actually have to deal with the consequences of theory. And it seemed that he saw losing his place in the establishment, the inner circle of decision making about what the future of the country should be, and how we should be dealing with these weapons, that it was a huge loss for him to lose his seat at the table inside. And he assigned basically zero value to the kind of moral mantle that he could and I think did pick up. It really gets at this kind of like professional managerial class and sort of noblesse oblige clashing. Yeah, there’s a piece from Vox on that last point by Haydn Belfield that’s called “Crybaby Scientist” that basically is just a — if you want to read the most anti-Oppenheimer take in this movie environment, that’s the place to go. And Belfield basically argues a version of what you just said, Lydia, that this was a guy who imagined himself as this core decision-maker, but who basically invented the bomb and gave it to the national security state and then was totally unable to manage or master the forces that he’d unleashed, while maintaining his desire to be seen as someone who was the insider sort of steering the ship. I think the piece is unfair to Oppenheimer in many ways, but it’s worth reading the strong anti-Oppenheimer take, which is also another question for you guys. There’s also been a lot of criticism of the movie from the left, arguing that it’s just too kind to Oppenheimer. It doesn’t spend enough time on the actual realities of what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, once again, Americans whitewashing their own evils via Hollywood. What do you guys think of that critique? My response to that is my response to a lot of these things, which is that not every movie or every piece is about everything. So this was about Oppenheimer. You can focus it on that. I mean, we can have another three-hour biopic on what about the fallout in New Mexico. I mean, there’s been talk about it has ignored what happened with the people who were downwind of the Trinity test. Yes, all of these are like questions, but again, not every movie is about every piece of a puzzle. It’d have to be longer than three hours, Michelle. And you already oppose that, so. No, I object on moral principle to movies that are that long. I think, first of all, it was a real choice not to portray or show anything from what actually happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which was utter and total and complete devastation. And when I finished the movie, I took the subway home and then immediately read John Hersey’s “Hiroshima,” which is an extraordinary book that really kind of gives you a sense of what took place there. And I think at the end of the day, I actually think that the way that the movie handled it was probably right. It would have felt, I think, somewhat gratuitous to go outside of the narrative of the movie and have newsreel footage or something that sort of gestured at the kind of destruction that this bomb actually wrought. And I felt that the moment where he’s speaking to a cheering, flag waving crowd, and they’re stomping their feet at Los Alamos, excited and celebrating that they’ve won the war by dropping this bomb on what was arguably a largely defeated enemy, he sort of has this kind of moment of conscience and what have you. So I think that was probably the right way to handle that. But the thing that was wild to me is there’s this moment where Oppenheimer says, sort of justifying the use of the bomb, that demonstrating the destruction of it will be so great that it’ll usher in the greatest peace that mankind has ever known. And in one regard, he was right in the sense that no one has ever deployed a nuclear weapon in a conflict situation since then. But in another way, we have not actually seen the greatest peace humankind has ever seen since then. So I don’t know. To me, that moment in the film really stuck with me. Yeah, there’s a moment when I think they’re showing images from the actual atomic bombings are being shown. And I think you see Oppenheimer looking away from it. Right? So in a way, the movie is giving his perspective and his sort of showing that for all his guilt and so on and sort of nightmares, there’s sort of the nightmare scene that you referenced, Lydia, of the jeering crowd with the sort of undertones of atomic destruction underneath it. For all that, Oppenheimer is also sort of maybe refusing to see, right? The movie doesn’t show you because Oppenheimer himself does not want to fully see what he did. The authors make a distinction between Oppenheimer taking responsibility, like yes, he made this thing, but not feeling guilt over it. And I felt that that was somewhat portrayed in the movie. What I liked, Ross, about that moment you mentioned when Oppenheimer looks away is that you see the colleagues around him, they’re all flinching. They’re watching. And it’s it’s painful for them. But he sees something and then immediately looks away. Well, and what’s also interesting is the justification, and I think actually, this has sort of become the conventional wisdom, was that even though Japan was on the verge of defeat, dropping the bomb saved lives, and you sort of see that in the amazing scene of Gary Oldman playing Harry Truman, sort of waving away the histrionic Oppenheimer saying he has blood on his hands. So yes, I mean, I think this notion that ultimately dropping the bomb saved lives has become the kind of conventional wisdom. And “Thank God for the Atomic Bomb,” which is a very influential essay by Paul Fussell in “The New Republic,” which was published in 1981, I think really sort of articulates that view. But I also think one of the things about the legacy of the atomic world in which we live that nobody really ever talks about is the Cold War had real consequences, and the fact that it couldn’t take place as a direct confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States meant that it pushed the conflict out into essentially the decolonized world, right? And the proxy wars of the Cold War, I mean, it’s, depending on how you do the math, somewhere between 10 and 25 million people died, depending on when you start counting and who you count. But wars in Vietnam, in Congo, in Ethiopia, which is my mother’s native land, Guatemala, all across Latin America. So it is interesting that there’s this kind of binary choice between the peace and never having a nuclear war, but boy, did it set off a huge number of proxy wars that just happened to have as its victims, not the people of the United States or Russia, but the people of largely the developing, poor, Black, Brown world. Yeah, and I don’t think you get a sense of that complexity from the end of the movie. My reading, at least, of the end of the movie is, is much more sort of binary, that it’s not that Oppenheimer created this sort of complex, new world where maybe direct superpower conflict becomes rarer, but proxy wars become more common. Instead, the movie ends with this vision of atmospheric destruction, fire spreading across all of the Earth, the true apocalypse that we’ve all lived in some kind of fear of ever since the 1940s. So in that sense, it’s presenting a vision of just sort of science slipping away from all political control and/or politics just doing what it will with terrifying technology. So let’s take a quick break here. And when we come back, we’re going to try and bring the conversation about the intersection of science and politics off the movie screen, out of the past, and into the present. So we’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back. So we’re going to talk now for a minute about not just what the story of Oppenheimer says about history and the early Cold War and the life of the man himself, but about our own future here, 80 years onward in the beginning of the 21st century, where the question hanging over lots of issues, nuclear biowarfare and biotechnology, now artificial intelligence, is, can human beings control and tame the technologies that we create that might have potentially world destroying consequences? So, for all of you watching a three-hour movie about the first time, arguably, the human race created such a technology, did it fill you with optimism about the human capacity to restrain itself once we’ve let certain genies out of the bottle? I don’t think we need to be feeling so optimistic. It’s not been around for that long. There’s still plenty of time for us to blow ourselves up, Ross. So there’s this one amazing moment in the book that I was hoping would appear in the movie, and that’s that when Oppenheimer dies, one of his three eulogists is George Kennan. So you have the father of the atom bomb being eulogized by the father of containment. And containment, of course, was the policy that, depending on how you interpret it, helped keep the two superpowers from going to war with one another with nuclear weapons. He has an amazing line in the eulogy. He says, on no one did there ever rest with greater cruelty the dilemmas evoked by the recent conquest by human beings of a power over nature out of all proportion to their moral strength. So it did not leave me with much optimism. There’s also this interesting development where Congress has looked at this movie and taken the opportunity to reintroduce some ideas about how to get their arms around it. I mean, we’ve seen Senator Ed Markey from Massachusetts hawking his proposal to ban AI from launching nuclear weapons. Now, I don’t think it’s going anywhere, but it’s got a very Dr. Strangelove doomsday machine feel to it. But it is what it is. Yeah, I mean, I think it’s so interesting because as I was watching the movie, I actually thought a little bit about — and don’t be mad at me. I thought a little bit about Elon Musk. [LAUGHS]: Lydia. He is not the kind of Sanskrit-reading sophisticate that Oppenheimer was. And he is also clearly of a different kind of political set of commitments, if you can even call them commitments, than Oppenheimer. But just looking at the various points of view that he’s taken, I think Musk shares this quality of bizarre naivete about the way that politics actually works. And I think like Oppenheimer, Elon Musk is a great synthesizer, perhaps not a great engineer of his own right. But there is this kind of protean quality that Elon Musk has. And in his naive replies to right-wing, even anti-Semitic and other people with those kinds of political views on Twitter, I do see kind of shades of a very crude version of Oppenheimer, which makes me feel like we’re in for a fair bit more of this kind of, quote unquote, “innovation” that is hurling forward without really thinking a great deal about it. I mean, Elon Musk has just announced that Twitter is going to become a company called X, which will be an everything company that is driven by AI and do banking and God knows what else. So hold on to your butts, guys. This is coming for us. But what’s interesting with Musk is that he is also a bit of an AI doomer, right, in the sense that he has been sort of supportive of some of the people calling for a pause in AI research. And a certain amount of Musk’s fascination with space travel rests on his professed fears about human extinction, the idea that we’re going to blow ourselves up in some way, shape, or form. Yeah, Musk is sort of skeptical. But in some ways, that’s the most dangerous, right? Because I think so was Oppenheimer, right? Like, there’s this quality of being both aware of and smart enough to know how destructive this thing could be, but also so smart and so curious and driven that you can’t help but want to push it as far as it can go. And it’s actually exactly in the hands of someone like Elon Musk, who professes to understand the dangers, but nonetheless hears the siren song of the future calling and of innovation and of science and of technology and sort of can’t resist following where it leads. Let me just play, I guess, devil’s advocate for a minute on the specific nuclear question, which I think is, it’s true, as Michelle said, that we’ve only had nuclear weapons for 80 years, 80 odd years, slightly less. And it is very hard for me to imagine a future in which they’re never used. There’s sort of a Chekhov’s gun quality to nukes in the world. At the same time, we do have multiple generations now of evidence that human beings, when given this awesome power, power to destroy whole countries, if not the whole world, do flinch from it, right? The idea that if you hand human beings an awesome, terrifying technology, they will just use it, has not been vindicated. So far, politics has actually worked to contain the use of nuclear weapons. The fear of AI is that it’s the fear of something that makes decisions that aren’t human anymore, that lead to destruction not through the sort of normal human power games and rivalries and so on that we’re all familiar with, but through some sort of alien computational logic, where it makes sense to fire all the nukes at once. And that, to me, feels like a difference between some of the fears we have now and the fears people had at the start of the nuclear age. Now it’s more like, well, we know what human nature is like, and we haven’t used the weapons, but we don’t know what AI is like. And maybe AI will use them. What do you guys think of that? I mean, there’s questions about loose nukes, dirty nukes. Obviously, the war in Ukraine, Putin is, I think, not a stable figure. But I do think the point that we have greater faith in the known frailty of human decision-making over the unknown power of AI decision-making and of rationality is a really important one. And I think that in some ways, it connects us back to the film in that science actually should be under the control of politics because in a moment where we’re all talking about we need to follow the science, follow the science, science is a method. It’s not an answer. It is a way of thinking about the world. And it needs to be balanced by other ways of thinking about the world. And those other ways include politics. They include religion. They include all kinds of ways that human beings organize their affairs and think about their values and things like that. So to me, it’s absolutely critical that AI stays as far away from these kinds of decisions as possible. Yeah, and I don’t think we have to limit this just to, say, AI and nuclear weapons. I mean, we did just come through a pandemic where there were serious questions about whether this came out of a scientific experimental lab that then takes its toll on the entire planet. I mean, and it’s just like people operate as though the unthinkable won’t happen until, of course, the unthinkable does happen. And even if what the COVID-19 pandemic wound up coming from wasn’t, in that case, a lab, which we may just never know, that doesn’t mean that the next one won’t. And we have all of these things going on scientifically that we just don’t have a good grasp on or as good a grasp as we should have. I think one thing that would be certainly more useful is if there is just an ongoing, vibrant conversation among all those arenas that Lydia mentioned — science, politics, ethics, religion. And to the extent that a movie like “Oppenheimer” and a book like “American Prometheus” cannot lionize scientists and say like, they’ve got the answers. If only we’d listened, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But rather, enable this more of a give and take among these fields, I think would be better off. Well, on that eloquent note, we’ll leave it there. And when we come back, we’ll be talking about the geopolitical metaphors hidden inside the “Barbie” movie. No, I’m kidding. When we come back, we’re going to get hot and cold. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back. And now it’s time for Hot, Cold, where one of us shares something that we’re into or over or somewhere on the thermometer in between. And Michelle, I think you have something for us. All right, it is perfection that Ross has mentioned “Barbie” because what I am hot on this week is the Barbenheimer phenomenon. Now, I’m not talking about the movies. I saw both of them. I enjoyed both of them. But what I enjoyed even more was the way that this phenomenon, which is for those who haven’t been paying attention, kind of the portmanteau sprung up on social media because these two wildly different blockbusters were opening the same weekend, a challenge sprung up for people to go see both movies. I love this because we’re at a period where going to the theater has become a rare event. And seeing movies as a shared experience is happening less and less and less. So for something like this to pop up just felt kind of delightfully communal. Movie theaters were hosting costume parties and encouraging people to come in their pork pie hats or their pink outfits. And you just had these groups of people, especially with the Barbie crew, including my friends and I, taking pictures of each other, complimenting each other’s outfits in the theater. It just had this feel, which was so unusual at this point in time. And it’s something that I think we need, especially after the last few years of isolation and grimness and pandemic horror, just for people to have a moment where they can come together, no matter how silly it is, and share this sort of thing. And celebrate the invention of the atomic bomb. Yes, that’s all — Hey, you can argue that Mattel and Barbie have been its own kind of destructive force as well. Well, that’s for a future episode. I was going to say that Mark Harris, the film writer, said something, I think, on Twitter about how often unexpected hits are more sort of shocking and disruptive in Hollywood than unexpected busts. And I think the hope right now for people who like the movies would be that Barbenheimer, combined with the disappointment surrounding many, many superhero sequels and Indiana Jones reboots and so on, will have some kind of substantial effect in what kind of movies get greenlit and made over the next couple of years, assuming, of course, that the writers’ strike ever ends, and that Hollywood ever gets back to making movies in the first place. This reminds me of a few years ago when Steve Martin was hosting the Academy Awards, and he started off saying, look, I don’t know if you all know this, but I’m really especially happy to host this year’s Academy Awards because all the proceeds from tonight’s event are going to massive corporations. So not to be a Barben whiner, but I don’t take such joy in kind of being manipulated effectively by this kind of massive marketing campaign surrounding these two movies. If you’re waiting for purity in your communal experience, you’re going to die lonely. This is America. I don’t think so. I think there are other ways to be communal beyond paying $35 for popcorn and a soda. I’m just saying, we’ve got to find a way to bring people back to communal events, rather than sitting in their basements watching Netflix all the time. Then I’m all for that. I agree, and I think I’ve really been bitten by the movie bug lately. I just recently signed up for a membership at Film Forum. I saw Jean-Luc Godard’s “Contempt,” a new print. There was a new print of “Midnight Cowboy.” So I’m all in on the return to the movies. And I don’t think any of those movies are putting money in the pockets of giant corporations that exist as we know them today. So I can feel really good about all of that. Until a Godard Cinematic Universe is launched. Launches, but I mean, I will say, one of the kind of leitmotifs of my summer has been just an absolute joy at the return to kind of communal experiences. We’ve seen real trouble in the world of theater, for example. I’m not talking about movie theaters. I’m talking about acting and actors on stage and things like that. And all of us need to vote with our feet and go and watch the theater, go to the movies, do things like this if we want these things — Thank you, Lydia. — to be part of our culture going forward. So I am with you, Michelle. I’ve got my bucket of popcorn, my giant gallon jug of Diet Coke, and Twizzlers. And I’m ready to go. So I guess I’ll see you at the movies. Fantastic. I’ll be wearing my hot pink disco jumpsuit. And on that note, as I clutch my Robert Oppenheimer action figure, that’s our show for the week. Bye, guys. See you next week.

      "text": "In a desperate attempt to find more space in my suitcase without having to buy a bigger one, I caved this summer and treated myself to some packing cubes. Although I had seen these little mesh bags on Amazon before, I had always considered them an unnecessary indulgence. When my set of nine bags arrived, I quickly became a convert, as rolling, folding and stashing my stuff in each little bag helped me to find those all-important extra inches in my carry-on. Costing just £9.99, my Amazon travel cubes blew my mind and I am pretty sure that they have changed the way I pack my holiday outfits, sandals and sun cream forever. The packing cube set I choose was just a basic one that came in a neutral grey colour. I opted for one of the lowest-priced options on Amazon in case I decided not to use them. For less than a tenner I was impressed to receive a set that contained: Three travel packing cubes with see-through mesh tops One private cube for bras and underwear, One travel shoe bag, One toiletry bag, One toothbrush cup, One laundry bag for dirty clothes and One flat bag for small items, like socks, electronic accessories or keys Made from nylon fabric, the cubes may not feel like they have been built to last a lifetime, but on the whole, they look like they will do the job on many future adventures. Each packing cube comes with smooth rolling zippers that open fully for easier packing and the mesh tops let me see what I have stashed in each bag without having to open and unpack it all. The shoe holder is only big enough for one pair of shoes, but the wash bag, makeup bag and toiletry bag are brilliant little bonus items and a great idea for when you don't want to take your full kit away with you. What do packing cubes do? Packing cubes can help you to better organise your suitcase and pack your items far more efficiently.

The cubes can also help you to make more space in your luggage, as the zippered design lets you compress your items slightly, making them a little more compact than if they were just folded.

      "text": "“The teaser and the trailer for the live-action ONE PIECE are both out now, and the launch date for the show itself is set for August 31. I’ll say this, there are no compromises on this show! And the festivities have already begun! It’s already fun seeing the flurry of reactions after each release of information. And the very fact that adapting ONE PIECE into live-action was conceived 7 years ago is wild! How will this world be brought to life!? There was so much that went into it – all the efforts by the actors, the building of the world and the costumes, presenting things in a way that can only be done in live-action, the dialogue, and the entire process of so many people putting their heads together was a festivity in and of itself. After the launch, I’m sure I’ll hear about some people pointing out how this character is missing or that scene is omitted, or this bit is different from the manga. But I’m sure they’ll come from a place of love, so I intend to enjoy even those comments! lol The story will span 8 episodes and take us up through you-know-where!! Even after the shoot was over, there were numerous scenes the production agreed to re-shoot because I felt they weren’t good enough to put out into the world. On the other hand, there were also some lines that I thought didn’t feel like Luffy on paper, but when I saw the filmed scenes, I went, “it works when it’s Inaki performing it as Luffy! As a matter of fact, it works great!!” (Inaki is the actor who plays Luffy) There was so much works that had to be done to keep things from looking too unnatural in live-action. The producers and the crew are pros at live-action and frankly, they’re ONE PIECE superfans, too. The more knowledgeable you are about ONE PIECE, the more you’re likely to notice the love they poured into this. It was June when we made the final decision to go ahead and launch this show. MY editor who’d worked so hard on this actually cried as he said, “It was such a long journey…” lol. Not that working hard on something guarantees success, of course. By now I just love this production team and the cast so much. I can’t wait for them to get the acclaim they deserve from everyone around the world. And if by chance people have some gripes, I’ll be there to receive them together! No, whatever feelings you choose to harbor in the meantime, it’s still going to be one month so please have some tea as you wait!”",

      "title": "Nemi&#039;s dispersed treasures",
      "text": "How ancient treasures from the sacred Temple of Diana on the shore of Lake Nemi, near Rome, ended up in Nottingham and Copenhagen. In 1885, when Sir John Savile Lumely, Her Britannic Majesty's ambassador to Italy, began excavating the area of the Temple of Diana at Lake Nemi in the Castelli Romani, Rome had been the capital of Italy for less than 15 years. The city was in an upheaval of expansion, restructuring and modernisation that involved the demolition and rebuilding of entire quarters in the historic centre. During the works an enormous quantity of ancient art came to light. At the time, not much thought was given to preservation and the protection of the new nation's historic heritage, and archaeological digs were little more than glorified treasure hunts. Sir John was approaching retirement and Rome was considered a suitable backwater where the diplomat could relax after a long and often turbulent career. But it also suited the ambassador particularly well as he was a passionate amateur archaeologist and the Rome post gave him the ideal opportunity to indulge his hobby. He turned his attention to the lesser known sites outside the city boundaries and decided to concentrate on the Lake Nemi crater where ancient sources had mentioned an important cult centre dedicated to the goddess Artemis-Diana. Lake Nemi: Pristine waters and a hidden secret Although it was recorded that a number of important pieces of sculpture had been purloined from the site over the centuries, Nemi was, from an archaeologist's point of view, virgin territory when Sir John arrived, and he was full of anticipation. Only a few years earlier, John Turtle Wood – an English surveyor and architect employed by the Ottoman railways – had made the spectacular discovery of the most celebrated temple dedicated to the Goddess Diana at Ephesus (in present-day Turkey), considered one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. Sir John probably nurtured secret hopes of a similar triumph. In actual fact, the astonishing number of finds which he unearthed during eight months excavating far surpassed his expectations. The crater was a veritable treasure trove, virtually untouched since the times of the Caesars. Sir John had negotiated the rights to dig in the Lake Nemi crater with the landowner, Prince Filippo Orsini, with the agreement that all the finds were to be divided between them. Unlike Sir John, however, Orsini’s interest was not of a scientific nature. He was in serious financial difficulties and he saw the excavations as a probable source of income. Roman antiquities were much in demand with foreign tourists as souvenirs to take home and museums in northern Europe and the USA were willing and eager to pay high prices for finds that would add prestige to their collections. Marble head found at bottom of Lake Nemi near Rome The agreement the prince made with the ambassador was that all the booty found on the site should be divided between them. However Orsini appropriated the items which he thought would most readily appeal to collectors and which would command the highest prices. In the end, Sir John was left with the \"pickings\", which nonetheless amounted to seven bales and sixteen cases full of ancient Roman antiquities, a total of 1,586 items in bronze, marble and terracotta, as well as several hundred Roman coins, all of which he donated to his home town of Nottingham. Orsini terminated their agreement when the English aristocrat began to turn up whole statues, including a particularly fine female herm, a male head which resembled Julius Caesar, and a bearded god's bust in Greek island marble. The prince realised that an authentic treasure trove was almost within their grasp – and he was not prepared to share it. His refusal to renew their contract when the license expired was one of the most bitter disappointments of Sir John's life. All the pressure that the British and American Archaeological Society in Rome put to bear on the prince to make him change his mind was to no avail. Orsini no longer wanted partners and when he subsequently re-opened the dig on his own account, he was rewarded with the discovery of a whole room full of sculpture – a princely cache, which he sold to the Danish beer magnate Carl Jocobsen and which was destined to enhance his burgeoning sculpture collection. Robert Fagan: Digging and dealing in Rome Sir John had actually stumbled on this important find when he had unearthed the herm of a Roman matron called Fundilia Rufa, one of the few pieces of portrait sculpture that he was able to take home to Nottingham. Fundilia, who was named on her plinth, was standing with a group of companions inside a votive chamber set against the back wall of Diana's temple. Orsini's men uncovered the entire group of sculptures, including a full figure statue of the same Fundilia, along with the statue of the man, Fundilius Doctus, who had paid her memory a unique tribute. His inscription identified him as Fundilius Doctus, a professional actor (Parasitus Apollonis, as the Romans called them) and explained that he was an enfranchised slave, who had belonged to Fundilia's family. The statue of Doctus is considered to be a masterpiece of Roman sculpture, and was in such perfect condition when it was found that for a long time it was suspected of being a fake. In Imperial Rome, many actors made personal fortunes. Evidently, Fundilius Doctus, a popular performer, had purchased his freedom and was rich enough to commission an artist to create his likeness, as well as the herm and statue of his former owner Fundilia, whom he must have held in high regard. The statues of both Fundilia and Fundilius are now in Copenhagen, along with the other herms that were found in the chapel. Nemi seeks damages for Nazi destruction of Caligula's ships The most surprising aspect of this discovery, however, was the fact that at least some of these sculptures in this same votive chamber were also actors, or connected to the acting profession. One was a comic player called Lucius Faenius Faustus. His inscription related that he specialised in the role of the “Parasite” – a rich man's dependent, or hanger-on, and a common figure of fun in first-century Roman society. Another was Norbanus Sorex, who must have been a famous performer, as his portrait was also found in the ruins of Pompeii. There were three other women. One, identified as Staia Quinta, was described as a hairdresser, while the other two cannot be identified with any certainty because the herm shafts were separated from the heads during Orsini's hasty excavations. The company was completed by a Quintus Hostius Capito, a teacher of the highly esteemed discipline of oratory, and an Aninius Rufus, who must have been related to Fundilia. Carl Jacobsen was apparently greatly satisfied with the Nemi purchases when they finally arrived in Denmark and he could appreciate their high artistic quality. But unfortunately he did not know where to put them. A couple of years previously, when the Christiansborg Palace had burnt down, Carl and his wife, Ottilia, had offered their private sculpture collection to the city of Copenhagen to compensate the loss of the royal collection. A site for a new gallery was chosen in Dantes Plads, near the celebrated Tivoli Gardens, but, due to a series of hitches, the building was not ready until 1897. Even before it was inaugurated, however, the exhibition space had become inadequate. Throughout the years of construction, the ever enthusiastic Jacobsen had continued to acquire more and more pieces of both antique and contemporary sculpture. Among them were a few important pieces that had been discovered a couple of centuries earlier by Cardinal Despuig, advisor to Pope Pius VI, who had done some excavation work in Nemi. Rome unveils ancient ruins of legendary Theatre of Nero Finally, in 1906, the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek opened its antique sculpture collection in a brand new state-of-the-art building where the various rooms are decorated to harmonise with the period of the works they contain, from the ancient Egyptians to the Etruscans, the Greeks and the Romans, and where the Nemi collection is on view today. At the Nottingham City Museum and Galleries, situated within the old walls of the one time mediaeval castle, only a selection of Sir John's finds are normally on display due to problems of space and a more recent focus on local history. However, a major exhibition, entitled The Treasures of Nemi was held in 2013, drawing an enthusiastic following. At the moment, the herm of Fundilia Rufa stands in the portraits section of the Gallery of Art. Other sample pieces from Sir John's collection are on show in the Myth, Power and Beauty section of the museum. In addition, the Collections Gallery, which concentrates on the history of the museum and its major 18th/19th-century donors displays a sample selection of the Nemi antiquities.

      "title": "Look cool when it's boiling hot: A guide to office dressing in a heatwave",
      "text": "Is your hot girl - or guy - summer getting a little too literal? Following one of the hottest July's on record, we’re all longing to sit in the shade, by a large body of cool water, wearing as little as possible. In a cruel twist of fate, many of us are still stuck in the office, melting as the mercury keeps climbing. If your brain is simply too addled by the constant planning of how to keep your electrolytes up to be able to give heatwave office outfits any thought, we’re here to help. Loose clothing: A must “Choosing outfits for the office when it is really hot can be tricky and rather depends on how strict your workplace is about what you wear”, Laura See, founder of luxury shoe brand Laura See London tells Euronews Culture. Whether you’re in a traditional, some might say stuffy, corporate environment or more of a casual Friday-leaning workplace, loose clothing is always your best friend at this time of year. Even if your dress code is particularly inflexible, it’s possible to put the close-fitting suits away until autumn. Caley Henry, a buyer at British institution Marks & Spencer, recommends sticking to a simple colour palette if your more structured clothing is hanging in your wardrobe until the first leaves start to fall. “Playing with proportions is an easy way to get monochromatic dressing right – a voluminous blouse adds lightness to belted shorts and chunky sandals”, Henry explains, adding, “Complete the look with a roomy tote to stow all your day-to-day essentials”. This summer, as seen on countless catwalks including the vast examples at Louis Vuitton , the bigger the better is where it’s at when it comes to bags. Pack your iced water, facial spray and fans - multiple, if needed - and you don’t need to overthink whether or not your loose outfit has pockets or not. Henry mentions shorts as a staple for a woman’s office wardrobe during a heatwave and while we’d advise shying away from anything cut too much above the knee, they’re an excellent option, especially when teamed with a loose blouse for maximum airflow. They’re a great choice for men, too. Alexandra of Alexandra Wood Bespoke, who styles, designs and tailors exclusively for men on London’s iconic Savile Row agrees: “During a heatwave it’s also acceptable to wear shorts, just make sure they’re tailored and cotton”. Don’t let shoes be an afterthought “As a rule of thumb: reserve flip flops for poolside settings only”, says Caley Henry. It’s often tempting to kick our shoes off entirely when suffering in the heat but, sadly, that’s rarely an appropriate solution in an office. “Heat escapes from our head and feet but that doesn't mean that flip flops or possibly even sliders are suitable footwear for summer”, Susie Nelson, style expert and founder of Modes and More tells Euronews Culture, adding, “There are lots of smart sandals, espadrilles and loafers that can be worn in the office”. While the choices are endless, Laura See has, in our opinion, got the answer. \"When it comes to choosing shoes I would always recommend wearing a pair that are made from natural products like leather, as they will allow your feet to breathe and not sweat as much as they would if you wear a pair made from manmade materials”, the shoe designer explains. Loafers or perhaps a smart boat shoe are ideal for men. See’s advice? “No one wants to see hairy toes at the best of times, so to keep your feet cool, opt for smart light suede loafers or, if acceptable, smart sneakers”. And for women? “Open toed mules are the best as they are easy to slip on and off and allow the air to flow over your feet which will help to keep them cool,” says See. Comfortable smart sandals are almost as good as flip flops for those of you bound to comfort but, if your office has a strict no-toes-whatsoever policy, the best bet is to opt for a closed-toe mule. They’re easy and speedy to slide on and off, making them the perfect choice to cool your feet down at your desk. Natural fabrics are key When it comes to fabric choices, avoid polyester - that is all. Sadly, that’s not the case but it is a rule to absolutely follow in a heatwave. There’s nothing worse in unbearable temperatures than underestimating how hot it really is and realising your dressed head-to-toe in synthetic fabrics. Alexandra Wood Bespoke advises her male clients, who want to look hot while keeping cool, to do the following: “Wear pure cottons and linen blends. Shirts made from pure fabrics help to cool the body down. Any hint of polyester traps heat and makes matters worse”. For women, a cream linen suit is a great investment piece. Ukrainian brand Sleeper makes a particularly special three piece which comes with a scalloped jacket and interchangeable shorts or trousers, depending how scorching it is when you’re getting dressed. Susie Nelson recommends another solution - sleeveless dresses and tops are ideal for averting dreaded sweat patches. She does have a warning though for those daring to bare a little more: “One last piece of advice - be careful with off the shoulder tops, as you can appear naked from the other side of the PC!” Colours: Go bright or light - and avoid dark tones It is often tempting to pull on a black or navy linen dress or suit just to avoid thinking too much about what to wear on a baking hot day but ‘tis the season to stand out. “There’s nothing we love more than a show stopping dress on a summer day, especially one that’s cool, roomy and easy to wear”, explains Caley Henry, adding, “you’re guaranteed to pull an airy maxi dress out of your wardrobe time and time again, so why not up the ante with bold colours?” If you’re the kind of person who has a wardrobe full of neutrals or loves nothing more than wearing all the colours of the rainbow, that advice is preaching to the converted. But if you’re more of the type who can’t wait for the muted tones of autumn fashion, may we suggest the colour of the summer - lavender. Shades of lavender are - quite literally - everywhere and on everybody and usually subtle enough for even the most colour-averse. If that’s going too far, stick to neutrals - whites, creams, beiges - as much as possible. While black looks chic at all times, the fact that it absorbs heat makes it a bad idea for boiling environments - avoid. Layering isn’t just for the shoulder seasons - and that includes underwear Your office may be unfamiliar with the very concept of air conditioning but, as temperatures continue to shoot up, many are being forced to install it. This, of course, creates another clothing dilemma, especially when you’re experiencing vastly different temperatures throughout the day. Susie Nelson has a solution: “One tip for staying cool and chic is layering. Staff working in cities usually commute on hot underground trains and crowded buses and will then arrive in a much cooler office environment”, she explains, adding, “the option to add or remove layers makes it a breeze to adapt to changing temperatures”. A favourite workaround for Euronews Culture is tying a sweater loosely around the shoulders. Inspired by the late, great Jane Birkin’s style in the ‘60s and ‘70s , countless influencers have adopted the look which gives an air of effortlessness to every outfit. Caley Henry suggests one particular hero piece for an office wardrobe in high summer: a sleeveless jumpsuit. It’s “the perfect bridge between office-friendly and summer suitable clothing… Wear it with a cardigan or lightweight blazer for fool-proof layering”, she says. Our last piece of advice? Be extra careful with underwear. If you’re effectively a sweaty blob running to catch the train to your office, it might be the last thing on your mind - but mishaps are more frequent than you might think. “Check your undergarments aren’t visible through the fabric - flesh coloured or white are best”, suggests Susie Nelson. Now you have our advice on how to keep cool while looking your very best from top to toe - and literally everywhere in between. All we can do is wish you the best of luck in achieving it. We’re off for a lie down in a freezer!",

      "title": "Tech executive's brutal kidnapping caught on surveillance video",
      "text": "This story originally aired on April 2, 2022. It was updated on Aug. 19, 2023. Tushar Atre, a successful tech-executive-turned-cannabis-entrepreneur had a multimillion-dollar home on the California coast, where he spent his free time surfing. His dream house turned into a crime scene in October 2019 – grainy surveillance video from that time shows he was attacked and kidnapped near his home. He was later found stabbed and fatally shot on his cannabis farm in the Santa Cruz mountains. The two crime scenes provided few clues, though guests inside Tushar's home told detectives they heard the intruders demanding to know the location and combination of his safe. Investigators from the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office did have that grainy surveillance video, which captured what happened on Tushar's street from the moment three shadowy figures entered the neighborhood and walked toward his house. Minutes later, Tushar is seen running and then is tackled. He is repeatedly stabbed and eventually pushed into a BMW the suspects stole from his driveway, before they all drive away. Who were those figures, and why would they want Tushar Atre dead? As \"48 Hours\" contributor Tracy Smith reports, it's a mystery that investigators would spend more than seven months unraveling. WHAT HAPPENED ON PLEASURE POINT DRIVE? In the hours after Tushar Atre went missing on October 1, 2019, his tight-knit Pleasure Point community was on edge. Reporter Maria Cid Medina covered the story for the Bay Area's local CBS station KPIX. Maria Cid Medina: We started knocking on his neighbors' doors. … Everyone was spooked. You could really see the fear in people's eyes when you talked to them. Who would target the 50-year-old tech exec-turned-cannabis entrepreneur, and would they be back for anyone else? The crime scene provided few clues. Tracy Smith: You've got a missing businessman, a pool of blood, missing car, what are you thinking? Steve Cercone: What I would be thinking … is that … This is a very unusual case, and potentially a very, very serious felony has just occurred. Steve Cercone is a former California police chief and a \"48 Hours\" consultant who's reviewed the case. Tracy Smith: Was there anyone else in the house at the time when he was kidnapped? Steve Cercone: There were several people in the house. Among them one of Tushar's employees who heard a commotion around 3 a.m. Mary Fulginiti: One witness … hears three different voices, one of them is Tushar's and the other are two unidentified males. Attorney Mary Fulginiti is a former federal prosecutor and also a \"48 Hours\" consultant. Mary Fulginiti: He hears Tushar screaming at times. Steve Cercone: He heard the suspects tell him to get on the ground … Mary Fulginiti: \"Put your hands behind your back.\" \"Where is the safe and what's the combination?\" Steve Cercone: Tushar pleading with them … \"how can we make this right?\" Tracy Smith: Tushar knew these guys? Steve Cercone: It seems like … he knew these guys. The employee in Tushar's house called 911 at 3:34 a.m., half an hour after the attackers had driven off with Tushar in a white BMW belonging to his girlfriend Rachael Emerlye. Tracy Smith: So, Rachael's BMW's missing, where's Rachael? Steve Cercone: Apparently Rachael was back east in … Massachusetts when this happened. Rachael says she learned about Tushar's kidnapping when investigators called her. Rachael Emerlye: I was trying to piece together what this all meant over the phone. \"I was just there. What do you mean? He didn't seem like he was in danger.\" Investigators learned Rachael wasn't just Tushar's girlfriend, she was also his partner in the cannabis business, which they had started together after they met in 2017. Rachael Emerlye: They asked me straightaway \"Where's the pot farm?\" The \"pot farm\" was 60 acres of open land nestled in the Santa Cruz mountains known as the Summit property, where Tushar could legally grow cannabis for research. He was planning to manufacture medicinal cannabis products. Claire Machado: Who would kidnap him? … You know, who would take this guy? Claire Machado, Tushar's right hand in various business ventures, learned the news about the disappearance from Rachael. Claire Machado: I called his phone. I said, \"wherever you are, we'll find you.\" Rachael Emerlye: I had such hope. Every (crying) second I held on to that, for hours and hours. Around 9:30 that morning — six hours after Santa Cruz County Sheriff's deputies had responded to the 911 call from Tushar's Pleasure Point address — investigators located the white BMW 14 miles away at his Summit property. There was blood on the outside and inside of the vehicle. And 20 to 30 yards away, they found the bloody body of Tushar Atre. Steve Cercone: Face down, and his hands were handcuffed in the back with flex-ties … An apparent gunshot wound to the back of the head … He had been stabbed multiple times. … and nearby they also found five shell casings from a .223 rifle. … That's an assault rifle. Tracy Smith: Did it look like an inside job? Steve Cercone: That's what … I'm sure was running through … the investigators' minds … how would they know where to go? They found him at his house … brought him up to his secondary property. So … they knew Mr. Atre. Nothing about the kidnapping or the murder indicated this was a random act, says Cercone. Tracy Smith: It had to have been someone close to him? Steve Cercone: It appears that it was definitely someone close to him. Rachael was on her way to catch a flight back to Santa Cruz when she got the news that Tushar was dead. Rachael Emerlye: Worst phone call of my life (crying) … When you're in your car you can just scream. But detectives had more questions for Rachael as soon as she got to Santa Cruz. Tracy Smith: Pretty standard to talk to the girlfriend? Mary Fulginiti: Oh, absolutely. Rachael Emerlye: I think they wanted to know … \"are you happy with this person?\" It was complicated. Rachael Emerlye: It's definitely hard to be in a relationship and run a business together. For the past six months, Rachael and Tushar had been living on opposite coasts while Rachael says she was working on expanding their medicinal cannabis business. They were focused on getting the Food and Drug Administration to approve their cannabis product. Rachael Emerlye: We'd gotten it to the point where we felt like this is the product we were trying to make. The couple had met two years earlier while she was renting one of his many Santa Cruz properties. Rachael Emerlye: He … came in and asked, \"do you wanna go surfing?\" … and beginner's luck, caught a wave … and he was like, \"yeah, yeah! Amazing, you're amazing.\" And Tushar was intrigued by Rachael's background in the world of cannabis, where her expertise was in agriculture and business development. Rachael Emerlye: It just seemed natural that he would pick my brain about my industry. They ultimately moved in together into his multimillion-dollar waterfront house. And Rachael says she invested her entire inheritance — about $300,000 — in their new cannabis venture. Rachael Emerlye: Tushar helped through my mom passing. When you see that side of somebody, you can be sure they love you. But mixing love and business came with some risks. Rachael's contributions to the enterprise weren't documented on paper, and that, says Claire, become a source of friction in the relationship. Claire Machado: She didn't have anything to show the level of investment, and he acknowledged that with me. And Claire says having informal agreements wasn't unusual for Tushar. Claire Machado: He played hard and fast and wasn't really good at documenting it in writing. Still, Claire and Rachael say Tushar was working on adding Rachael's name to the business, and that things were going well. Rachael Emerlye: Tushar always had the intentions for us to have written agreements. He was very kind to me in business. Claire Machado: Rachael was still in love with him, she wasn't that pissed off. She wanted to work it out with him. Now both women were trying to figure out why anyone would want Tushar dead. Claire Machado: Everyone loved Tushar … most everyone loved Tushar. Claire Machado: Rachael had expressed to me … that Tushar was receiving threatening phone calls. Steve Cercone: This was a whodunit from the start. Maria Cid Medina: There were not immediate suspects …. you got a sense that investigators did not have any leads in this case. But there was one lead — grainy surveillance video of three figures approaching Tushar's home. A LONG LIST OF POTENTIAL SUSPECTS Maria Cid Medina: What set the tone about this story is that there were a lot of rumors … We had to sift what was truth and what was rumor. While investigators weren't naming any suspects in Tushar's case, rumors persisted about Rachael. Maria Cid Medina: That was our first question, was Rachael connected to his murder? Claire Machado: I feel the most sorry for Rachael. She's had to grieve … as well as defend herself. Tracy Smith: So, it was easy to rule her out pretty early on. Mary Fulginiti: I think so. Mary Fulginiti: If anything, she loses more with him being deceased than she does with him being alive. Maria Cid Medina: You got this sense that investigators did not have any idea who his killers were. Three weeks later … investigators announced that there would be a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. But as the weeks turned into months, and after several appeals by Sheriff Jim Hart for the public's help, the investigation seemed to stall. Maria Medina: There was a desperate plea to the public to find these killers. In mid-November, nearly a month-and-a-half after Tushar was murdered, the sheriff's office raised the reward to $150,000, and this time they asked for help in identifying three suspects seen in the eerie surveillance video as they approached Tushar's house moments before the attack. Maria Cid Medina: It was the first time that we ever heard investigators had … any sort of evidence from that scene. One of the three shadowy figures, investigators say, is carrying an assault rifle. Tracy Smith: What kind of criminals walk through a residential neighborhood with an assault rifle in plain sight? Steve Cercone: Yeah, not real wise. … at any moment they could have been spotted. Maria Cid Medina: You felt goosebumps, because you knew what was going to happen next. But the video didn't generate any new leads, deepening the mystery around the murder, Tushar, his business dealings and the people who worked for him. Reporter Maria Cid Medina dug deeper into his background. Maria Cid Medina: Tushar had a different side to him, a darker side. I started to search online after his neighbor said that he had made enemies … connected to his business dealings. There were accusations from Tushar's investors that he was dealing in the cannabis black market, though Claire insists he was doing everything by the book. Claire Machado He wasn't a gang-related mafia-related drug lord kind of a guy. Even if Tushar wasn't a mob boss, he had quite a reputation as a bad boss – and not just in the cannabis business, according to online reviews by ex-employees. Maria Cid Medina: I discovered on Glassdoor.com, his company, AtreNet. … One employee wrote, \"The CEO, Tushar Atre, doesn't value anyone but himself.\" … Another … wrote, \"Total abusive nightmare. The worst employment experience of my life. You've been warned. Run away now.\" Even friends told investigators the charismatic businessman enjoyed being confrontational. Claire Machado: He challenged his employees to try to always do their best. And even though that was tough, I appreciated that about him a lot. But not everyone appreciated it. Mary Fulginiti: He had a lotta people apparently in his past that had it out for him … people that had rammed into his vehicle, people that had taken his property and … destroyed it. Steve Cercone: A lot of it had to do with money. Money that was not paid. Investigators learned Tushar was notorious for withholding people's pay. When he did it to Claire, she quit. Claire Machado: He came and found me and hired me back. And at that point, he was a lot nicer to me. Claire says she was helping him change his management style. Claire Machado: He wanted loyalty, and you might get loyalty through fear, but not the same kind of loyalty that you get through love … I believe he learned that in the end, and he was trying to make a number of things right. Rachael Emerlye: He would come up with these challenges for himself … and he said, \"I'm on day 13 of no yelling\" (giggles). As the list of Tushar's disgruntled employees and associates grew, so did the potential suspects. From investors who'd poured over $4 million into his cannabis company and were unhappy with the way Tushar was managing the funds to a subcontractor with whom he'd had a heated argument the night of the murder, Santa Cruz County Sheriff's detectives would have to talk to them all. Tracy Smith: As investigators started digging and talking to people, were there any names that kept coming up? Steve Cercone: Two of the names that kept popping up were Stephen Lindsay and Kaleb Charters. …who didn't work for him very long. Tracy Smith: Because they had a beef with him? Steve Cercone: They had a significant beef with him over a payment. Kaleb Charters, 19 and Stephen Lindsay, 21, can be seen in video working on Tushar's Summit property in August of 2019, just a couple months before Tushar's murder. Tracy Smith: What did employees say about them? Steve Cercone: They said they were not very happy with Mr. Atre. … apparently, he'd made them do push-ups … in front of other people, which … if that were the case, they were most likely humiliated. Tracy Smith: Tushar actually made them do push-ups as, like, a -- punishment? Mary Fulginiti: Yeah. … And then ultimately doesn't pay 'em. Steve Cercone: After they received the check, the check had been canceled. In December 2019, Santa Cruz County Sheriff's detectives traveled to Las Vegas where Kaleb Charters and Stephen Lindsay had moved, to question them. Mary Fulginiti: During that interview … Lindsay did say … He wanted to get into a fight with this guy … He wanted the money that Tushar owed him … And he actually wanted to get into a physical altercation, and he told the police this. Steve Cercone: He finally paid them again. But this time, he paid them only partially. Lindsay was shown the grainy surveillance video of the three suspects and denied knowing them. Both men said they hadn't even been back to Santa Cruz since they stopped working for Tushar in late August. Tracy Smith: Did they make it sound like, oh, the beef was all over? Steve Cercone: Yeah. They said … they had … settled it and they were not gonna work for him anymore. Detectives left Las Vegas without arrests, and by January 29, 2020, the sheriff increased the reward again, to $200,000. Investigators also shared the kidnappers' suspected route from Tushar's home to the Summit property. Maria Cid Medina: It seemed that they were desperate for any clues from the public. But what police weren't sharing with the public was additional surveillance video that captured what happened on Pleasure Point Drive that night. Maria Cid Medina: Tushar did put up a fight. And at some point he was able to get away from his kidnappers. FOLLOWING THE DIGITAL TRAIL While investigators had only released to the public a small portion of the surveillance video showing those shadowy figures approaching Tushar's home, there was a lot more video from that night they were analyzing for clues. Steve Cercone [watching the surveillance video]: As you'll see here, Mr. Atre breaks from the driveway, and he runs. He's pursued by one of the suspects. He tackles him right here. And then as you can see … there's a struggle. A few moments after his attackers leave him, Tushar somehow finds the strength to pull himself up and make one more dash for freedom – until one of the suspects stops him again. Moments later, the BMW appears and Tushar is pushed into the front seat before the car speeds away. For months, investigators analyzed the video and footage from other cameras near the crime scene and along the route to the Summit property where Tushar's body was found. Finally, more than seven months later, arrests. On May 19, 2020, the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office had four suspects in custody. That's right – the same Stephen Lindsay and Kaleb Charters who had worked for Tushar and admitted they once had a bitter pay dispute with him. Remember, detectives had interviewed the pair just two months after the murder. Suspects Kurtis and Kaleb Charters were brothers and Lindsay was their brother-in-law. Joshua Camps was a friend. Maria Cid Medina: These were four young guys. All four suspects charged with murder, kidnapping, and robbery. None of them had a criminal history. In fact, Stephen Lindsay and Kaleb Charters were members of the Army Reserve. At the time of the arrest, Lindsay, who goes by Nick, was attending a city college in Los Angeles, along with Kurtis, where they were producing student videos. Kaleb was in Michigan, and Josh Camps was about to get married. But if Lindsay and Charters were on Santa Cruz County Sheriff's radar back in December, why had it taken another five months to arrest them? But at a preliminary hearing in October 2021, prosecutors would set out to prove those shadowy figures in the grainy surveillance video were their suspects. Cameras were not allowed at the proceedings. The state had to convince a judge they had enough evidence to try Stephen Lindsay, Joshua Camps, and Kaleb and Kurtis Charters for robbing, kidnapping and ultimately murdering Tushar Atre. The Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office laid out their monthslong, meticulous investigation, piece by piece. Steve Cercone: I think the … evidence here … is very compelling. And the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office, the investigators did an amazing job. Tracy Smith: How important was digital evidence in this case? Steve Cercone: Digital evidence may make this case. Early on, detectives had identified a blue sedan. It was seen on several surveillance cameras on October 1, 2019, heading to Tushar's home before the abduction and then minutes later heading towards the Summit property. That piece seemed to fall into place when they learned Josh Camps owned a blue Camry. And sure enough, when they showed up to arrest him … Steve Cercone: The blue Camry was also there. Tracy Smith: The car that got them to Santa Cruz. Believing they had the suspects' ride parked in his driveway, investigators also had a search warrant for the rest of Camps' house -- not knowing just how much clearer the picture was about to become. Tracy Smith: What did investigators find when they searched Josh Camps' house? Steve Cercone: Yeah. They found a lot of — lotta firearms. They found some flex-cuffs. … And they had the same … manufacture date that were on the wrists of Mr. Atre. Tracy Smith: Did any of these guns match the murder weapon? Steve Cercone: They did not. Even though Camps didn't have the murder weapon, investigators say he did have ammunition that matched the spent rounds found near Tushar's body. And prosecutors revealed investigators had also found other forensic evidence. Mary Fulginiti: What we learned … from the preliminary hearing is that there were two prints — palm prints of Kurtis Charters' that were found on the BMW. Tracy Smith: And that's it? Mary Fulginiti: That's all the forensic … evidence that was introduced at the preliminary hearing. Placing Kurtis in the BMW was a start. But needing more, investigators turned to the suspects' cell phones. They didn't find any data for Stephen Lindsay for the night of the murder. Tracy Smith: So why don't we have Stephen Lindsay's cell phone data? Steve Cercone: Yeah. So, the investigators found out that Stephen Lindsay — his phone had been shut off from the 27th of September till October 5th. So that's about eight days. And I don't know anybody … in their early 20s that would have their cell phone off for eight days. When detectives talked to Lindsey in Las Vegas back in December 2019, he told them he was home the night of the murder. But in a group text from that night, Lindsay's wife suggests she didn't know where he was. Steve Cercone: She was texting Stephen, her husband, and her two brothers, Kaleb and Kurtis, for hours, wondering where they were. … That shows the three of them were likely together because she is reaching out to all of them together. Investigators hoped cell tower data for Kaleb and Kurtis Charters, as well as Josh Camps, would help connect the dots. They were able to plot their locations on a map, providing the routes each device took. And there it was. Steve Cercone [pointing to map]: So, this is the surveillance camera showing … the Camry going towards Mr. Atre's house at Pleasure Point Drive. Then, at around 2:48 a.m., their phones ping off a tower covering Tushar's neighborhood at exactly the point those figures were caught on camera emerging from the alley heading towards Tushar's house. Mary Fulginiti: That was critical. That actually puts these individuals, or at least their phones, in the right location, in the right place to be able to start to corroborate this video that really shows a large chunk of the crime. At the same time, Kaleb Charters' phone and the blue sedan are seen traveling away from Tushar's house towards the Summit property. Tracy Smith: So now we're in a different location. This is on the way up to Summit? Steve Cercone: Yeah … now the detectives … have placed Kaleb's phone — on the way to the Summit right here … off of Highway 17— in the Santa Cruz mountains. Followed 17 minutes later by Kurtis Charters' and Joshua Camps' phones and the white BMW carrying the stabbed and gravely injured Tushar. Tracy Smith: What do we see here? Steve Cercone: So now you have all three cell phones of the suspects placed in an area … around the Summit property. That's pretty clear. At 3:36, 3:35, 3:36 in the morning on the day of — the murder. The cell phone data bolstered the investigation theory that Kaleb Charters had dropped off his codefendants and waited for them at the Summit property. And that Kurtis Charters and Joshua Camps had participated in the kidnapping at Pleasure Point Drive. But there was no direct evidence placing Lindsay at either crime scene. Mary Fulginiti: There's no eyewitnesses, there's no fingerprints, there's no DNA, there's no physical evidence linking him to the crime. But investigators believed that video showed what Stephen Lindsay had done. A PERFECT TARGET? Rachael Emerlye: He had a really bright flame … I don't know why anybody would want to dull that. Tushar's flame might still be burning brightly, if not for a chance encounter less than two months before his murder that had led Stephen Lindsay and Kaleb Charters directly to the successful CEO's waterfront doorstep. Claire Machado: He had the dream beach house, he was a surfer, he was driving a Porsche … anybody looking at that lifestyle who didn't have it could be easily jealous of it. Tushar had hired Lindsay and Charters after one of them had made a telemarketing call to one of Tushar's associates. Steve Cercone: It was very random. … And they came up to Santa Cruz. And … he let them … into his home. That's when former police chief Steve Cercone says they got a glimpse of Tushar's lavish lifestyle. Steve Cercone: They got close enough to him to learn a lot about his operation, about his wealth. And in Tushar Atre, the suspects had found a perfect target. Tracy Smith: He actually gave them a tour of his home? Steve Cercone: Yeah … and showed 'em where his bedroom was. The bedroom was where Tushar kept his safe, and in it, say investigators, more than $80,0000 in cash. Steve Cercone: This is very unusual. And very risky. Tracy Smith: What does that say about Tushar Atre? Steve Cercone: I think Tushar was pretty naïve at times. Was that safe one of the reasons they targeted Tushar that night? Steve Cercone: This is the alleyway that they came down … If the idea was to rob the millionaire, the plan had gone horribly awry. At the preliminary hearing, the prosecution would lay out their case, playing that shocking surveillance video. Investigators say the three shadowy figures walking towards Tushar's home that night were Stephen Lindsay, Kurtis Charters, and Joshua Camps – seen in the video, they say, carrying an assault rifle. Cameras had been rolling from the moment they entered Tushar's neighborhood on Pleasure Point Drive. Tracy Smith [walking with Cercone on Pleasant Point Drive and pointing to a security camera]: Down this way … So, the first camera … that captures them is right over there? Steve Cercone: Right. Right. What happens next is chilling. Steve Cercone [pointing to monitor with surveillance video]: Right here is 70 yards from there to there. Steve Cercone: Mr. Atre is gonna sprint from his driveway … he's gonna run down Pleasure Point … as fast as he can go with his hands tied behind his back. And he gets tackled. Tracy Smith: Who's that? Steve Cercone: That right there is … Stephen Lindsay … This is a brutal, brutal attack. According to the investigators, Lindsay is the first to attack Tushar. Steve Cercone: And if you watch the suspect's hands, it looks like he's stabbing him repeatedly. Tracy Smith: Yikes. Steve Cercone: With a poking motion. Mary Fulginiti: And then you start to see … a little bit of a dark substance, which … later they were able to determine was blood. Next, say investigators, comes Josh Camps. Mary Fulginiti: You see Josh Camps running, handling something to Stephen Lindsay. Stephen Lindsay runs back to the house. Tracy Smith: What do you think was handed off between Stephen and Josh? Mary Fulginiti: If I had to guess I would say … keys to the white BMW. Seconds later, investigators say, after Lindsay runs back toward the house, the BMW headlights come on as Camps continues the attack. Steve Cercone: [describing the surveillance video]: Camps then holds him down and … Now he looks like he's stabbing him directly, viciously Mary Fulginiti: Jabbing him and jabbing him. … And then Stephen Lindsay comes driving vehicle, which we end up learning was the white BMW. As the glistening pool of blood gets bigger, the BMW pulls up. Steve Cercone: Now, watch what Mr. Atre does. This is —in a survival mode right here. In really good shape. Tracy Smith: Oh my gosh — Steve Cercone: He gets up. He's handcuffed, pool of blood there, and he runs. Wounded and bleeding, Tushar attempts to get away a second time, but investigators say Kurtis Charters goes after him. Tracy Smith [pointing to surveillance video]: And this is Kurtis? Steve Cercone: This is … Kurtis, yeah, running after him. Tracy Smith: Tushar was fighting for his life. Steve Cercone: Yeah … I'm sure he was doing everything he could to get away from these guys. Mary Fulginiti: They go after him with the vehicle this time. …And … Kurtis is the one that ultimately grabs him and puts him in the car. And then they all drive away. About six hours later, Tushar's body would be found 14 miles away at his Summit property, riddled with stab wounds and a fatal wound gunshot wound to the head. At the time of the arrests, Santa Cruz County Sheriff's investigators announced that Tushar's kidnapping and murder was a robbery gone wrong. But the brutality of the case suggests there may be more to the motive. Steve Cercone: This is a very, very curious case … a lot of it doesn't make a lotta sense. Tracy Smith: If this was a robbery, why chase him, tackle him, and take him away? Mary Fulginiti: If this is truly just a simple robbery and all you care about is the money in the house and nothing else, once he runs away you let him go. You grab the money then you get out of dodge. But as investigators would later learn, what set in motion the attack that night was anything but simple. Tracy Smith: This is about more than just money. Mary Fulginiti: It's definitely about more than just money. WHO SHOT TUSHAR ATRE — AND WHY? The harrowing surveillance video of Tushar Atre fighting for his life gave investigators compelling evidence – a record of what happened in the street. But what happened off camera? The biggest questions: Who shot Tushar? And why? The answers may come from Kaleb Charters, Kurtis Charters and Josh Camps. They started talking the day they were arrested. But Stephen Lindsay never said a word. Tracy Smith: What was Kaleb's role in this? Steve Cercone: His role, he admitted was to drop them off … and he went up to the Summit property. Kaleb Charters' admission he was the driver matches his cell data and that surveillance video of the blue car heading in the direction of the Summit property. With their ride 14 miles away, Steve Cercone suggests the group had planned to steal a car all along. Tracy Smith: That they knew … they could take that BMW. Steve Cercone: That they knew that they could take that BMW. Kaleb Charters' interview provided investigators his version of how the robbery was supposed to play out. Mary Fulginiti: Kaleb's interview actually talks about the plan. And he has two plans, a Plan A and a Plan B. So, Plan A … they didn't expect … Tushar to be there. Plan A involved using the front door code to Tushar's house that Kaleb said he remembered after working for him months earlier and collecting all money and valuables they could find. Plan B, if Tushar was there, involved forcing their way into his bedroom safe — the one investigators later found held over $80,000 in cash. Kaleb Charters also revealed how they would open that safe. Mary Fulginiti: The muscle was Josh Camps. Josh came armed with a weapon. Why? … Well, according to Kaleb, Well, to scare him, in case he was there. Just to scare him, so that he could open the safe. Tushar was home – and Kurtis Charters admits he restrained him. Mary Fulginiti: He admits, and he takes responsibility for, you know, putting the flex-cuffs on him, and gagging him. But once they took Tushar up to the Summit property, Kaleb and Kurtis Charters made it clear shooting Tushar was never part of the plan. In his interview, Josh Camps initially tried to pin the shooting on the others. Steve Cercone: It's very apparent that Josh, at the beginning and for quite a while, kept lying to them … Josh then decreased his lying … and eventually he started to fess up. He makes what amounts to the most damning admission of them all. Mary Fulginiti: He ultimately admits to shooting Tushar, and to killing him. Tracy Smith: And he ultimately tells investigators where the weapon is? Mary Fulginiti: Correct. But he said there was a reason he pulled the trigger -- an act of mercy. Mary Fulginiti: He says it was a mercy killing, though. He doesn't say it was an intentional killing. It was one that, you know, they did because they thought he was gonna die. …because he was bleeding so heavily. Mary Fulginiti: A mercy killing is not a defense to murder. And, you know, he still pointed the gun at his head, and he killed him. And at the preliminary hearing, the lawyers for Kaleb Charters, Kurtis Charters and Stephen Lindsay jumped on that statement. They argued that their clients never meant to harm Tushar during the robbery — that it all went horribly wrong when Tushar tried to run away, and that Joshua Camps acted alone. But Mary Fulginiti says, even with Camps admitting to being the shooter, the other defendants aren't off the hook. Mary Fulginiti: They're charged with what they call felony murder, which means if a murder is committed during the commission of a felony, and here we have a couple of them — we've got robbery and kidnapping, then under certain circumstances, all of those involved can also be … held responsible for the murder. And that's -- that's critical here. And Kurtis Charters shared with investigators that this might have been more than a robbery from the start. Mary Fulginiti: What he did say … is that he did think that Stephen Lindsay wanted to kill Tushar, and that he thought Stephen Lindsay had a vendetta. Tracy Smith: When we talk about motive, does this story of Tushar humiliating Stephen Lindsay and Kaleb Charters point to motive? Mary Fulginiti: Yes. Definitely. Fulginiti speculates it goes back to Tushar making enemies of the two former military men. Mary Fulginiti: With regard to Lindsay, he was pretty upset with the way Tushar treated him. Mary Fulginiti: When you look at … the military … respect is a large component of how they lead their lives … Tushar humiliated them … he made them do push-ups … He paid them and then withdrew payment … he is feeding into that disrespect … and mistreatment. At the end of the preliminary hearing, the judge decided all four suspects should face trial on all counts. \"48 Hours\" reached out to their attorneys; they declined to comment. All four suspects have pleaded not guilty. If convicted they could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. They didn't get the $80,000 in the safe. Based on their statements, they got a few thousand dollars that they found in the house, a camera and a guitar … for allegedly taking a man's life. Maria Cid Medina: People are looking forward to this trial starting. And they want to see justice served, especially Tushar's friends. Justice, whatever that might look like, will never be enough to make up for all Tushar Atre had left to give. Rachael Emerlye: His charisma was infectious. … It's insane. It's not meant to be understood. An entrepreneur and an adventurer with so many mountain trails left to climb, waves still to surf, and melodies yet to strum on his guitar.

      "title": "The £26 M&S nightie that is this summer's hit dress",
      "text": "On a recent weekend away with a couple of girlfriends, post morning coffee, I announced I was off to get dressed. My friend looked up, confused: 'I thought you were dressed? Do you sleep in that?' Some collect crockery or niche miniatures but my weakness is Victorian-esque nighties: 'that' was a new stealth add to my collection. Pale pink, puff-sleeved with pretty pintuck and broderie anglaise details – it's a steal at £26 from M&S. I may have also got one in white. While I fully intend to sleep in them, I will also chuck both in my case this summer for the beach – the perfect multitasker. Before I'd finished explaining this to my friend, she'd jumped online to order both colours for herself – as daywear. We're not alone. Between Gen Z snapping up vintage lace-trimmed slips in charity shops and the catwalks proffering the peekaboo negligee as partywear, the fashion lines between bedwear and daywear have never felt so blurred. At Coachella, actress and singer Zendaya wore a pink frilly slip for her guest appearance, Acne's latest campaign features the model Devon Aoki in a frilled satin dress lying on coordinating bed sheets, while at JW Anderson's menswear show models paraded down the catwalk clutching pillows – a trope repeated on a recent Harper's Bazaar cover. Jacket, £45, marksandspencer.com. Basket, £45, phase-eight.com. Shoes, £170, ancient-greeksandals.com. YOU features writer Charlotte Vossen roadtests the £26 nightie from marksandspencer.com See also the 'beach pyjama' matching shorts and shirt sets (I'm a fan of Arket's black linen co-ord, from £45, arket.com, and With Nothing Underneath's cool blue pinstripe set, £160, withnothingunderneath.com) and also glossy, feather-edged party pyjamas (as seen on Succession actress J Smith-Cameron) for nights out. This trend for bedwear-inspired fashion has been growing over the past few seasons but comes into its own when the days get hotter, and the lure of waft and ease becomes essential. I've long been a fan of the pretty Victorian cotton styles from English Rose Linens, especially its lovely coloured floral embroidered details (from £22, englishroselinens.co.uk), and Lunn Antiques (from £27, lunnantiques.com). The sleeveless versions make sweet beach-day throw-ons. There is also a clutch of newer, design-led brands exploring this idea of bedwear for day. Faune, launched in 2017 initially with a range of kidswear, was the brainchild of two school friends, Nicola Niblett and Delia Moulding, who'd left their jobs in fashion and advertising respectively and saw a gap in the market for cotton children's nightwear. 'Nobody was doing that kind of old-fashioned nightie,' says Niblett, whose collection of vintage pieces from Parisian flea markets gave her inspiration. In 2020, they expanded into womenswear and have had huge success, with repeated designs selling out. 'Wearing nightwear for the day has been our mantra from day one. Our customers tell us that it's too pretty to keep for bed,' Niblett says of her hand-drawn designs. The ethereal, timeless pieces all come with exquisite details. Earrings, £135, assuwa.co.uk. Bangle, £225, carouseljewels. com. Bag, £40, Accessorize, next. co.uk. Shoes, £390, loeffler randall.com The Camelia (£185, faune.co.uk), with extravagant cotton lace sleeves and flattering deep V-neck and back, is the first dress they created and still one of their bestselling designs. I love the Vintage Rose and new Terracotta colour. Also available are simple slips to wear under the more transparent white cotton voile dresses. If Only If is another small label that takes its cue from traditional styles, but with a modern twist. It's run by Emily Campbell, who took over from her mother in 2020 ('We come from a family of nightdress obsessives,' she says). The hand-smocked, cotton blousy pieces – available in sizes 6-24, and for children – are ideal for blistering summer days. 'I think today's women are looking for investment pieces,' says Campbell, 'items they can wear over again, and in multiple ways. Our customers like the nighties as day dresses or for special occasions, and we've even had WE’VE EVEN HAD A CUSTOMER GET MARRIED IN ONE OF OUR NIGHTIES a customer get married in one.' The writer Pandora Sykes is a fan: 'They're so forgiving – floaty and feminine without being girlish or prissy. I wear mine around the house, on the beach and by the pool. They're wasted on mere beds.' Also worth a look is Sleeper, the cult Ukrainian brand, whose linen, puff-sleeved Atlanta dress, £267 (net-a-porter.com), in various colours and prints, has become a fashion favourite. It's these perennial designs that are at the core of this style of dressing – they're shapes you'll want to revisit every summer. Equally, a nightie you can wear year-round – in bed through winter, then on the beach on holiday – creates space for more workhorse wardrobe pieces. If you prefer a minimal feel, Desmond & Dempsey's linen slip dresses, in block colour and the label's unique prints, are a cool statement. Finally, for something white hot, Hill House Home has brought its bestselling Nap dresses to the UK. At a dinner for the launch earlier this summer, guests including Princess Beatrice came decked out in all their floral finery (founder Nell Diamond describes them as her 'Victorian ghosts'). Slung over each diner's chair was an extravagant lace cape, with their initials on the back. Which really was a sight going back home on the tube. NIGHTIESTO DAY £130, ifonlyif.co.uk £35, Ghost x M&S, marksandspencer.com £24, next.co.uk DAY TO NIGHTIES £276, the-sleeper.com £19.99, hm.com £89, ghost.co.uk",

      "title": "Tokyo Station’s second-most popular bento is great because of what it isn’t【Taste test】",
      "text": "Unassuming inarizushi just might be the best bento to grab at Tokyo Station. Inside JR Tokyo Station, there are a lot of…well, there’s a lot of everything. A lot of train lines (10 regular and four Shinkansen). A lot of people (almost half a million passengers a day). And a lot of bento boxed lunch options. With too many bento options to count but only one stomach, obviously you’re going to have to narrow down your choices. Helpfully, Gransta and Ecute Tokyo (a pair of shopping areas connected to and within JR Tokyo Station) have recently released a list of their most popular, best-selling bento. At the top of the ranking is the premium Jo-nigiri sushi set from Tsukiji Takewaka’s Gransta branch, and at number three is the Fukagawa Bento with Fukagawa-meshi, a dish where rice and clams are steamed in the same pot, from Tsukiji Kiyomura. Since the Gransta/Ecute bento rankings exclude bento from other regions shipped in to Tokyo Station, it’s not surprising to see sushi and Fukagawa-meshi in the top three, as they’re both things Tokyo is famous for. What did surprise us, though, is the second-most popular JR Tokyo Station bento: the Gransta-Exclusive Six-piece Inarizushi Assortment from Mameda. Inarizushi is a kind of sushi in which vinegared rice is wrapped in a thin sheet of fried tofu. Different shops and restaurants will mix different things in with the rice for different flavors, but with Mameda’s inarizushi set sandwiched between the more luxurious sushi and Fukagawa-meshi bento, we wondered what made it so popular, so we decided to try it for ourselves. Sure enough, when we arrived at Mameda’s counter inside the JR Tokyo Station ticket gates on basement level 1, there was a line of people waiting to buy their inarizushi. ▼ Inarizushi You can order individual pieces, but we went with the Gransta-Exclusive Six-piece Inarizushi Assortment, which is priced at 960 yen (US$6.95). That price works out to 160 yen per piece, which is a little on the pricy side for inarizushi, but not prohibitively so. Appearance-wise, these aren’t especially different from the inarizushi you’ll find at Japanese supermarkets. The set gets you one inarizushi each with anago (saltwater eel), shiitake mushroom, wasabi, ginger, and gomoku (carrot, shiitake, and lotus root) fillings. The sixth piece gets a special filling that changes each month, and when we stopped by in July it was myoga (Japanese ginger flower buds). We tasted them one at a time, and they were all good. However, as a simple dish that Japan’s been eating for generations, inarizushi is almost always good. Even supermarket and convenience store inarizushi is pretty tasty, and while Mameda’s is clearly a step above those, it’s not like it’s going to completely change anyone’s perceptions by reaching some sort of previously unfulfilled potential that we never knew inarizushi had. But as we continued eating, the Gransta-Exclusive Six-piece Inarizushi Assortment’s number-two ranking started to make sense. Like we mentioned above, Tokyo Station is the nexus of a lot of different train lines, and while it’s a commuter hub, it’s also one of the primary jumping-off points for travel to other parts of Japan. If you’re going to be spending the next few hours on a train to get to your vacation destination, you’re going to need something to eat along the way, so what’s the best thing to choose? You want something filling, but not so heavy that you’ll still be stuffed when you get off the train. The opportunity to eat lots and lots of local regional foods is, after all, one of the primary reasons people travel in Japan. And if you’re going to be eating on the train, out of consideration to the other passengers you want something that doesn’t have a strong smell and isn’t going to make a mess. Inarizushi checks off a lot of those boxes. It has that magical filling-but-light quality that’ll keep your stomach from rumbling but still leave you with space to go get some Nagoya chicken wings, Kyoto green tea sweets, or Hiroshima okonomiyaki as soon as you get off the train. There’s no risk of splashing and little chance of spilling anything as you eat it. Mameda’s six-flavor assortment gives you some variety to enjoy without having to run around to a bunch of different shops or hash out the selections yourself if you’re in a hurry to get to your platform, and it’s also easy to share with friends, family, or whoever else you’re traveling with. Taking all that into consideration, Mameda’s inarizushi set really is a great choice, not necessarily as a culinary destination itself, but as arguably the ideal part-of-the-journey meal.

      "title": "From 'Race Records' to AI Drake: How Technology Entwines With Hip-Hop",
      "text": "This story is part of our new Hip-Hop: ’73 Till Infinity series, a celebration of the genre’s 50th anniversary. “There could not be hip-hop without technology,” Bobcat Goldwav told Gizmodo via phone last week. Goldwav is a Baltimore-based hip-hop producer with 15 years of experience working in the genre who has also found success posting his beats, samples, and mashups on TikTok and SoundCloud. As we look back on this revolutionary genre during its 50th birthday this month, it’s crucial to consider the ways technology has played a central role in hip-hop’s history: its relationship with the recording industry, its production through the 80's and 90's, the way it’s consumed today, and what comes next. Hip-hop is widely recognized as beginning in 1973 in The Bronx, New York. One party played an enormous role in its origin sotry: DJ Kool Herc, the stage name for 18-year-old Clive Campbell, spun records at his sister’s back-to-school party in their apartment’s rec room. Herc played records on his dual turntables, but the moment that birthed a genre began when he looped an instrumental snippet of James Brown’s “Give It Up or Turnit a Loose” and rapped over it. Over the next five decades, hip-hop evolved and iterated upon itself countless times, but technology—or lack thereof—became a crucial piece of the puzzle before DJ Kool Herc was even born. While phonography, the art of recording sound onto a physical form like a disc or cylinder, was developed in the 1870s, it wasn’t until circa 1939 that the music industry saw widespread recording of Black voices. “It’s called a race record, and the race records were literally just to say that this is a record that features the voice of a Black person, and that becomes a bankable commodity,” A.D. Carson told Gizmodo. Carson is a hip-hop artist and an Assistant Professor of Hip-Hop and the Global South at the University of Virginia. “[T]his happens because of racism, because the people who were recording or who were using the phonographic technology to make records literally believed that Black people’s voices were meant to be heard live but were not suitable for recording technology at the time.” Six years after Herc spun, and decades after Black voices were first recorded, singer and record producer Sylvia Robinson married the two into a single piece of technology—the rap record. Carson credits Robinson with being the first to invent the rap record, after she gathered a band and a group of kids to perform a song in a studio in 1979. That song was “Rapper’s Delight” by the Sugarhill Gang, and it was the track that forced hip-hop to become a, as Carson described, a “bankable commodity,” and shifted the genre from a live one to a recorded one. “The shift from hip-hop on the stage or hip-hop at a house party to hip-hop as something that you could sell as an eight track or whatever it might be, that’s a technological intervention,” Carson said. “She invented the rap record.” Hip-hop quickly became music’s biggest fad. While most trends in the music industry come and go, the genre remained strong through the 80's and 90's. During that time, hip-hop production took on a new form. Drum machines like the famous Roland TR-808, released in 1980, allowed producers to experiment with new sounds and textures. Meanwhile, rappers also began experimenting with tape loops, where a section of magnetic tape from a cassette would be spliced end-to-end to create a nonstop section of repeating music, much the same way Herc did with his turntables in 1973. Producers also got creative with technology they already had on hand. Carson said, for example, that producers eventually figured out that they could slow down a track to half speed on a tape player or record player, which effectively allowed them to double the amount of music they could sample when they sped it back up. At the turn of the century, rappers continued to push the boundaries of the technology they had at their disposal. Autotune, for example, is a pitch correction software that was released in the late 90's, but rapper T-Pain saw it as an opportunity to add a distinct digital and robotic texture to his voice during his early career in the mid to late-2000's. His 2009 track “Buy U A Drank” propelled him, and the effect, into the mainstream. Meanwhile, digital audio workspaces, or DAWs, became ubiquitous in studios everywhere, centralizing all of the analog tools producers used previously into one piece of software. These DAWs made computers the instrument and ushered in completely new production workflows and subgenres of hip-hop like “chipmunk soul,” in which producers like Kanye West and Just Blaze chopped up vocal samples from soul records and pitched them up, all while laying rap on top. West used the technique on his 2004 song “Through the Wire” in which he sampled Chaka Khan’s “Through the Fire,” released in 1984. DAWs are still an integral part of music production today, and Goldwav points to his weapon of choice, Ableton as a DAW that lets him do everything. The software is also used by hip-hop hitmakers like Kenny Beats, who has produced for Gucci Mane and Roddy Rich, and LondonOnDaTrack, who worked on Drake’s “Sneakin’.” “I love Ableton because you can do anything in it. However you choose to create you can create fully in Ableton,” Goldwav said. “If I want to just track audio, or if I want play guitars, and drums, and record instruments, I can do that. If I want to just chop up samples and rearrange things and play MIDI, I can do that if I want to. If I want to take all my recordings and everything and play it live and improvise live, I can do that.” While the music industry has a whole has made a shift away from analog machines for producing, there will always be a place for hardware in hip-hop production. Goldwav said that devices like the Maschine offer an opportunity to get away from the computer screen and use tactile pads to create music. The Maschine a piece of music-making technology developed by Native Instruments that producers can connect to their DAW to make entire beats using the tech’s drum pads, knobs, and switches. “You are taking source material, or a piece of it, and repurposing it, recontextualizing it, and making it something completely its own,” Goldwav said. “I love the beauty of sampling. I love hearing someone else tell me their musical history through what they sample. It’s so powerful because it allows for everyone to give their own individual voice to what they choose to bring to the equation.” Today, technology is not only developing and influencing the creation of hip-hop, but it’s also changing the way the genre is consumed. Hip-hop is no longer gatekept by radio DJs and the likes of MTV, and anyone with a few dollars to spare every month could access nearly the entirety of the genre whenever they wanted with streaming services. Throughout the 2010s, platforms like Spotify and Apple Music democratized the way music was consumed, and hip-hop skyrocketed in popularity, becoming the most streamed genre on those services. Carson said that this phenomenon is a powerful representation of facing American culture’s tendency to tell a pristine version of its own problematic history—a version that frequently undermines the Black experience. “[That trend] demonstrates that the there’s a kind of narrative power that is coming not from the powerful institutions that have previously given us music and given us the mythological stories about the country,” Carson said. “I think that streaming services, or the consumption of hip-hop, is a direct line to what lies beneath the veneer of America.” Hip-hop’s AI problem Like industries across the world, hip-hop producers are struggling to decide what to do with artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, an AI-generated song called “Heart on My Sleeve” that uncannily mimicked the voices of Drake and The Weeknd was pulled from streaming services after it started going viral. Major music labels have also sounded the alarm over copyright issues in this uncharted territory—Universal Music Group asked streaming services to forbid AI engines from scraping their content. Carson, in an article he penned for The Washington Post, cautioned that the role of AI in severing Black voices from their bodies is indicative of the way early rap pioneers were exploited and appropriated. Goldwav said that he doesn’t want to stop the freight train of AI’s recent surge in popularity, but he wants to find productive ways to add it to his workflow. “AI is the big wave that’s coming for everything at the same time, and it causes a lot of fear and paranoia, but at the same time, it’s also a powerful tool,” said Goldwav said. “I try to not focus so much on the fear of the inevitable because I’m just a producer. I cannot stop the wave of AI, but I can try to implement it into my set up to allow me to do what I better.” From the beginnings on DJ Kool Herc’s turntable in The Bronx to the controversy surrounding an AI-generated rapper on TikTok rapper, hip-hop has grown and changed as technology has done the same, but where the genre will take AI is anyone’s guess.

      "text": "August is traditionally a great month for cinemas to attract families for a movie or two before kids head back to school. But the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes have forced some studios to delay planned film releases, which means your top new entertainment options may be streaming movies and shows you can watch from your couch. That’s where we come in. Every month, we publish a full list of what’s new on eight of the most popular streaming services in America: Netflix, Hulu, Max (formerly HBO Max), Disney+, Prime Video, Apple TV+, Peacock, and Paramount+. Among the streaming highlights in August are a new comedy special from Stow native Chris Fleming (Peacock), the third season of “Only Murders in the Building” (Hulu), and the return of HBO’s training camp documentary “Hard Knocks” (Max), which will focus on Aaron Rodgers and the Jets this season.

      "title": "Singing the blues: Playback singer Mukesh at 100",
      "text": "Year 2014. Surrounded by snow on either side of the road, a taxi waded through the Russian port of Murmansk, about 150 km from the ‘end of the Earth’ in the Arctic Circle — where tourists go in search of the Northern Lights. As he drove, Roma, the cab driver, played his favourite Raj Kapoor numbers. Composer duo Shankar-Jaikishan’s Mera joota hai japani (Shree 420, 1955) and the Chaplinesque Awara hoon (Awara, 1951) rumbled through the speakers, while Roma sang along lyricist Shailendra’s lines in Hindi, with a strong Russian accent. Generations of Russians have seen and loved Kapoor’s films and songs. In the 1950s, a time when the Soviet Union was still recovering from World War II, amid the poverty and shortage of food, they found hope in Kapoor’s on-screen character, Raju, a Dickensian hero who smiled and sang through his pain. Playback singer Nitin Mukesh and his son and actor Neil Nitin Mukesh sat at the back of Roma’s car. Neil was in Murmansk to shoot for Abbas Mastan’s Players (2015) and Nitin was accompanying him. They asked if he knew who had sung these songs. Without batting an eyelid, Roma answered, “Mr Raj Kapoor”. A beaming Nitin told him that the singer was Mukesh, his father, and not Kapoor. A stunned Roma stopped the car, held Nitin’s hand, and with eyes welling up, spoke of how he grew up with these melodies and this voice. “It was quite amazing and strange. We were so far away from home, surrounded by a white stretch of snow, and here was a man tearing up about my grandfather’s songs from over 50 years ago. It was surreal. It put Mukesh saab’s brilliance and significance in perspective for me,” says Mumbai-based Neil. *** “Main toh sirf ek jism hoon, haad maans ka putla hoon; Rooh agar koi hai mujhme, toh woh Mukesh Chand hai (I am just a body, flesh and bone. If there is a soul inside of me, that’s Mukesh Chand),” Kapoor had once said in a speech about his onscreen voice and playback singer Mukesh Chand Mathur, a singer from Delhi’s Daryaganj, who would become one of Hindi cinema’s most iconic playback voices. Be it the innocence of Jeena isi ka naam hai (Anari 1959), the austerity of Sajan re jhooth mat bolo (Teesri Kasam, 1966), the frolic of Dum dum diga diga (Chhalia, 1960), the vulnerability of Kahin door jab din dhal jaaye (Anand, 1971), the pathos-laden Ye mera deewanapan hai (Yahudi, 1958), a poet reminiscing in Main pal do pal ka shayar hoon (Kabhi Kabhie, 1976) or a clown’s philosophy on life and death in Kapoor’s reflective Jeena yahan marna yahan (Mera Naam Joker, 1970) Mukesh’s voice imbued these pieces with a simplicity that relayed the emotions of the common man and spoke of love, loss and the transience of human relationships. “With Mukesh, it never felt that a professional was singing these songs. It was as if this person was telling you what he felt,” said poet-lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri in an interview to Doordarshan in the ’90s. If Hindi films were once the opiate for Indians, their music was the soundtrack of our lives. Lyricists and composers Hasrat Jaipuri, Shailendra, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Naushad, Shankar-Jaikishan, OP Nayyar and Anil Biswas produced compelling narratives for the films and their melodies catapulted playback singers into superstars. Mohammed Rafi, Manna Dey and Lata Mangeshkar’s voices reverberated in every home. *** Mukesh was 17 when he came to Mumbai with actor Motilal, who had heard the Class X student sing along with his harmonium at his sister’s wedding to entertain the baraat. Until then, Mukesh’s only training had been from a music teacher who taught his older sister classical music. His father, a businessman with 10 children, was hoping that Mukesh would study further and become a clerk. He wasn’t keen on a career in films, which was unpredictable and not for ‘children from good families’. But Motilal dangled the one name that Mukesh’s father recognised — KL Saigal — and that his son could be a bigger star than Saigal, a renowned name of the time. He agreed. Once in Mumbai, Motilal gave Mukesh food, shelter and made sure that he honed his skill under a music teacher. This was 1940 when Hindi cinema was at a nascent stage and the singer-actor culture was prevalent. “He was a good-looking man, so he was offered a film,” says Nitin. Mukesh’s first project was a film named Nirdosh (1941), where he starred opposite actor Nalini Jaywant. But the film tanked and so did Mukesh’s first song — Dil hi ho bujha hua toh. The company shut down and Mukesh was out of a job. “After this, I became a share broker, a dry-fruit seller and did one thing after another as playback singing as a profession did not exist until 1942, when Debaki Bose began singing in Calcutta,” said Mukesh in an interview to BBC Hindi. “He tried film distribution, too, but that didn’t work either. He soon realised that it was better to be a first-class singer than a second-class actor. So he focused on music,” says Nitin. It took Mukesh four years to find the next opportunity. Motilal, who was the lead in Mazhar Khan’s Pehli Nazar (1945), helped him get one song in the film. Mukesh recorded the piece — an Anil Biswas composition — in a nasal timbre, an attempt to ape Saigal. Everything went well, but Khan refused to include the song in the film claiming that the grief-stricken song for an otherwise boisterous hero in the film, would be a drag. Upon many requests from Mukesh, it was agreed that the song will be in the film for a week and will be removed if it didn’t work. The song, Dil jalta hai toh jalne de, a salve for broken hearts, would go on to rule the airwaves for weeks to come and still remains a cult classic. “Those who walked into the cinema halls, came out with that one song which has stayed on till today,” says Nitin. Mukesh became popular overnight . And as legend goes, when the song reached Saigal through radio, he is known to have asked, “When did I record this one?” “There couldn’t have been a bigger compliment,” says Neil. Soon, with composer Naushad’s help, who suggested he sing in his own voice and not emulate Saigal, Mukesh developed his own style. The result were classics such as Gaaye ja geet milan ke (Mela, 1948) and Hum aaj kahin dil kho baithe (Andaz, 1949). And so, he had arrived. Unlike the classically trained voices of his brilliant peers such as Talat Mahmood, and later Rafi and Manna Dey, Mukesh’s voice felt huge-hearted and nuanced— the voice of a man you could talk to, share your thoughts with. It came with subtle but exact expressions, and for the most part, did not sound overtly ambitious. It was just right, wondrous and philosophical. But while Mukesh could sing most songs with ease, it was the plaintive notes that he came to be identified with sad songs. Mukesh plumbed the depths of a nation’s soul. Songs such as Sahir Ludhianvi’s battered but hopeful Woh subah kabhi toh aayegi (Phir Subah Hogi, 1958), or Heeraman’s poignant ballad Sajanwa bairi ho gaye hamaar (Teesri Kasam, 1966), the moving pukaar in Aa laut ke aaja mere meet (Rani Rupmati, 1959), the wistfulness of Ek pyaar ka naghma hai (Shor, 1972) or that epic love triangle classic, Dost dost na raha in Raj Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar and Vyjayanthimala-starrer Sangam (1964) were a testament to that. “If I get 10 light songs and one sad song, then I’ll leave those 10 songs for that one sad song,” he told BBC Hindi, a few months before he passed away in 1976. Ninety-year-old Anandji Shah, of noted music duo Kalyanji-Anandji, who worked extensively with Mukesh, told The Indian Express, “His voice could accentuate sad songs like no one else. Ours was a time of social and romantic dramas and the way he’d emote such tender emotions was brilliant. If I look at any of our songs by Mukesh saab such as Koi jo hamara hridaya tod de, Chandan sa badan, or Chaandi ki deewar, he’s emoted so tenderly. In fact we won our first National Award in 1968 for Saraswatichandra and Chandan sa badan was the marqee piece.” The pathos in Mukesh’s voice even moved a musician of the stature of Manna Dey, who owned the entire collection of the singer’s over 1,000-song oeuvre, would often say, “Would I ever be able to sing like him? With the pain that Mukesh ji finds and channels in what he sings?” According to Nitin, his father was great at pathos not because of any struggle in his life but because of his sense of empathy. “He was a compassionate person. There were small but beautiful things he would do. Even at the peak of his career, if he was leaving the city for concerts, he would go up to the couple who cleaned the building to tell them he was leaving, ‘But Nitin is at home in case you need something’. The guy who ironed our clothes had invited him to his daughter’s wedding once. He not only went but also sang a couple of songs for the gathering. Back in the day, most people, especially the famous ones in the industry, would not consider doing such things,” says Nitin, who will spend the year touring and singing tribute concerts for his father. Shah has always called the singer “Kalyug mein Satyug ka aadmi” and that he was one of the most genuine and sincere artistes in the film industry. “He worked for the love of the art and wasn’t interested in any politics,” says Shah, who adds that once he got Manhar Udhas (Pankaj Udhas’s brother) to record one of the Kalyanji-Anandji songs because Mukesh wasn’t available. They told Manhar that this was a scratch and that Maukesh will come back and record. “When he came back and heard the track, Mukesh ji told us that it was a perfectly well-sung piece and that the original should be retained. His earnestness kickstarted Manhar Udhas’s career,” says Shah. In case there was a new actor in the industry, many composers always asked Mukesh to sing for him. “Because Mukesh’s voice on the hero meant that the song would be a hit. We tried this with Manish Kumar in Saraswatichandra (1968) and Dharmendra in Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere (1960),” says Shah. Also well-known are his friendships with other playback singers such as Rafi, Dey, and Mangeshkar. “So much so that when he heard Rafi’s Din dhal jaaye in Chetan Anand’s Guide (1965), he wept,” says Nitin. He picked up the phone, called Rafi, and told him ‘Why can’t I sing like you?’. Then there was his reverence for Mangeshkar and her music. The two were close friends. In fact, they were touring in the US, when Mukesh had a heart attack in his hotel room in Detroit, 30 minutes before he was to go on stage, and passed away. He was 53. When Nitin and Mangeshkar brought Mukesh back from Detroit, a nation wept. Kapoor was inconsolable. At the funeral, he kept saying, “Meri toh awaaz hi chali gayi (I have lost my voice)”. Songs that spoke to us Dil jalta hai toh jalne do (Pehli Nazar, 1945): Mukesh’s first playback, this gave the singer an indelible identity: of a man who could deliver sorrow like no one else Awara hoon (Awara, 1951): This was the song of free, newly-Independent India, one that along with a couple of others, established the Chaplinesque image of Raj Kapoor Mera joota hai japani (Shree 420, 1955): This patriotic piece became an anthem in India and the Soviet Union Ye mera deewanapan hai (Yahudi, 1958): The song became the go-to number for the brokenhearted Sajan re jhooth mat bolo (Teesri Kasam, 1956): Mukesh sang Hasrat Jaipuri’s moving and philosophical lyrics, describing the futility of life Woh subha (Phir Subah Hogi, 1958): With much symbolism for the times, this contemporary political message was about the sharp social divide. Sahir Ludhianvi needed a tune that would relay his thoughts gently, without being a recitation, and yet with the effect of recitation. Composer Khayyam went to one of his favourite ragas ,Yaman Kalyan, and singer Mukesh to create this melody of hope. Suhana safar (Madhumati, 1958): One of Salil Chowdhury’s finest, Mukesh’s voice and Dilip Kumar’s charisma made it an audience favourite Kahin door jab (Anand, 1971): Yogesh’s lyrics and Mukesh’s soulful voice are the enduring appeal of this song about memories, fears and not wanting to let go Jeena yahan marna yahan (Mera Naam Joker, 1970): In Kal khel mein hum ho na ho, gardish mein taare rahenge sada, the joker sang of a transient world Main pal do pal ka shayar (Kabhi Kabhie, 1976): This merged the concept of the fleeting nature of an artiste’s fame with that of the poet’s own life",

      "title": "Cool Puzzles In 2023 - LA Weekly",
      "text": "It’s never a bad time to get going on a new puzzle. Whether you’re a seasoned veteran in the jigsaw game or simply looking for a new and engaging home activity, a puzzle is a great way to get your mind working while taking a pause from the TV, or the hustle and bustle of the modern world. There are a dizzying amount of options out there — an endlessly expansive array of iconic scenes, beautiful art pieces, and eye-popping colors — combined with a wide range of difficulty levels for puzzle fans looking to take it easy or gear up for a challenge. If you’re in the market for a new puzzle, you’re sure to find the perfect one on our list. These offerings are cherry-picked from our favorite companies, with options so plentiful we candidly had a hard time narrowing this list down to only 10 really cool puzzles for adults! 1. Mesa Puzzles – Brooklyn Bakery (500 pieces, 16” x 20”) Exploring the constantly moving New York City borough of Brooklyn, the scene depicted in this puzzle doesn’t even seem too far removed from reality, though it’s sure to put a smile on your face. The puzzle features six dogs of various breeds effortlessly modeling in and outside of a Boerum Hill, Brooklyn bakery. The earthy, muted tones of the dogs’ coats and the storefront contrast with a vibrant floral display throughout the piece, and it’s simply a funny and adorable scene to behold. Mesa’s collection of dog jigsaw puzzles is unparalleled. 2. Le Puzz – So Random (500 pieces, 18” x 25”) This Le Puzz puzzle is at the top of our list for cool jigsaw puzzles because it embraces a vintage look with an avant garde sense of humor, and this is all too clear looking at the abstract, and aptly named, So Random puzzle. The image is incredibly colorful, featuring — you guessed it — a random assortment of items put together in one quirky, still life image. This puzzle practically doubles as an “I Spy” image, featuring a pink clog, an oversized screw, a small beach chair with a huge egg on top, a clock with misplaced numbers, and more. In “So Random” fashion, the back of the puzzle includes a game of M.A.S.H. 3. Ordinary Habit – Ecstatic Motion (500 pieces, 16” x 20”) Dive into Priscilla Weidlein’s whimsical take on a typical afternoon with this delightfully colorful and detailed puzzle! The piece features a chunky cartoon cat sitting vacantly on a lounge chair surrounded by plants, paintings, and a diverse collection of interior patterns. It’s a nice affirmation of why we love puzzles in the first place — to slow down, relax, and live in the moment in our spaces. The amount of details Weidlein packs into this piece also makes it endlessly entertaining as the puzzle comes together. 4. Jiggy – Lazy Girl Book Club (800 pieces, 18” x 24”) Readers especially will get a kick out of this puzzle, featuring art from Natalie Linnea playfully riffing on the titles of well-known novels. The titles call to a feeling of comfort and security of the home, coinciding with the cozy nature of puzzles as a whole with reworks like, “Sherlock’s Home,” “The Girl on the Couch,” “The Devil Wears Nada,” and “The Subtle Art of Not Leaving the House,” all plastered through a gorgeous array of monochromatic peaches and a perfectly contrasting forest green backdrop. 5. Chuffed – Sunset Commute (1,000 pieces, 19.7” x 27.6”) Take a journey on this otherworldly subway on this fantastical Sunset Commute. The artwork by Deb JJ Lee blends an array of blues and pinks, immediately transporting you to the unique scene filled with humans and forest animals. You might find yourself working on this 1,000 piece puzzle for a bit, but having more time with this serene and surreal artwork is far from a bad thing! 6. Piecework – Psychedelicatessen (1,000 pieces, 19.25” x 26.6”) This isn’t your typical deli… The Psychedelicatessen puzzle speaks for itself, featuring an eclectic spread of deli items like a reuben, a collection of bagels, and a root beer float, but as you look closer, things aren’t quite what they seem. Featuring an array of trippy colors and a handful of interesting visual illusions, this puzzle is just as fun to put together as it is to visually explore. As Piecework itself says, “Deli food has never had this much fun.” 7. Puzzledly – Fresh Air, Don’t Care (500 pieces, 14” x 19”) Great for lovers of the outdoors, fantasy, cartoons, and of course puzzles, Puzzledly’s Fresh Air, Don’t Care offering immediately emits a child-like, carefree vibe, featuring a playful mountain scene underscored by a collection of eye-catching pastels and polarizing shades throughout the color spectrum. Kids and adults alike will love watching this puzzle come together, perfect for anyone to let their imaginations run wild and get lost in the clouds of this quirky, curious universe. 8. New York Puzzle Company – Fun in the Sun (1,000 pieces, 19.25” x 26.625”) Escape the heat and get a vintage taste of summer with this classic puzzle. Fun in the Sun lives up to its name, featuring a lively array of iconic convertibles surrounded by a slew of tanned, swimsuit-wearing beachgoers. The scene calls back to summers of the past, with ‘60s style graphics referencing a classic Americana vibe, and it’s a great way to appreciate the hotter months and some of the cultural relics of years past. 9. Crocodile Creek – Transportation of the World (1,000 pieces, 20” x 27”) Looking for a visually stimulating challenge with a little education to go along? The art behind Transportation of the World is already something to behold, featuring an eclectic and busy collage of more than 150 types of transportation from around the world. Not only is the puzzle itself beautifully illustrated, but it also includes a guide to help identify all of the transportation methods as you put the puzzle together. 10. Cloudberries – Gradient To top off our list, we’ve included a popular — perhaps somewhat infamous — puzzle, though it’s not for the faint of heart. This Cloudberries puzzle features a simple color gradient, as though you were dragging and dropping in a Photoshop color picker. If you’re looking for a unique, one-of-a-kind challenge, look no further. However, Cloudberries assures its customers that this puzzle is “surprisingly intuitive to complete.” Perhaps it’s worth seeing for yourself! How Do I Choose a Good Jigsaw Puzzle? There are plenty of quality jigsaw puzzles available online and beyond, but that’s not to say every puzzle out there is a solid pick. Consider these elements when setting out to purchase a new puzzle: Materials Most jigsaw puzzles are made from paper or cardboard, though you’ll surely stumble upon other interesting iterations, like wooden, acrylic, or even rubber puzzles. Many materials can be quality so long as they are resilient. This can be challenging to gauge without actually holding puzzle pieces in your hands, but ideally, pieces will be somewhat thick and/or resistant to folding. Cut You may find puzzles that have unique cuts, with different shapes for each piece, or recurring shapes. It’s generally up to your preference which you choose, but arguably more important is the quality of the cut. Fitting pieces together should be simple and precise, and there should be limited or no excess trimmings. A dull die (the machine that cuts puzzles) will ultimately lead to a bad cut, which typically results in a less than ideal puzzle experience. Size and Pieces There are two elements to consider here: How large do you want the puzzle itself to be when it’s finished, and how many pieces are you willing to work with? You’ve got plentiful options at your disposal here, with puzzles less than 100 pieces and up to thousands along with a plethora of sizes. There’s no right or wrong here necessarily, though we definitely recommend starting small and working your way up before tackling a massive puzzle. Design Arguably one of the most important parts of picking a puzzle, the design should be something you won’t tire of as you work. Consider picking a design with details you’ll enjoy taking a closer look at as you go. Part of the fun of a puzzle is soaking in those little elements you may not have noticed otherwise! Bear in mind, more intricate designs can pose a challenge, especially depending on the number of pieces. Similarly, puzzles with highly uniform colors and designs can also be more difficult. Are Jigsaw Puzzles Good For Your Brain? Puzzles have been around for centuries, and not just because they are fun to put together. That’s right, working on jigsaw puzzles does indeed have a host of cognitive benefits! Memory Working on a jigsaw puzzle involves focus, and distractions can often lead to setbacks and mistakes that will ultimately add unneeded time to your total venture. This extra concentration can help to benefit your memory, given that you must stay focused and ignore distractions to efficiently complete a puzzle. The more puzzles you do, the better your brain gets at falling into this cycle naturally, which can work to benefit other areas of our lives. Problem Solving Jigsaw puzzles involve patience and concentration, and optimizing these skills can ultimately help to improve focus and attention span. This combination also calls for analytical thinking, in this case sorting through how all of the pieces fit together. Where exactly does this color appear in the picture? Does it happen multiple times? How long does this pattern persist through the picture, and how many puzzle pieces will that likely translate to? Critical thinking, logic, patience, and perseverance are ultimately needed to complete a puzzle, and improving these skills can, in turn, boost your problem solving abilities. Concentration and Focus Completing and framing a puzzle is a tedious task. Sure, you can probably pop on a movie or show in the background, but you won’t get far if you try to actively watch it while you work. Puzzles demand our full attention, and completing a puzzle ultimately means we’ve put everything else in the background to take on the task at hand. Of course puzzles improve our concentration and focus! Stress Reduction This isn’t to say that actually putting a puzzle together is always the most serene experience. It can be a difficult task and comes with its array of challenges, but jigsaw puzzles offer a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction upon completion. There are endless ways that folks may work to complete a puzzle, but the end goal is always the same. Whether it’s an afternoon or a number of weeks, puzzles take work! Also, the sheer act of taking time out of your day to focus on the task can also act as moments of reprieve, especially in today’s world of constant news, media, and streaming. An intentional break is sometimes all we need to embrace a bit of calm! How We Chose Our List for the Coolest Puzzles Our list focused on puzzles between 500-1,000 pieces, with a range of options for newbies and returning puzzle fans alike. Jigsaw puzzles can range greatly in difficulty, so we didn’t get carried away but still threw out a handful of more complex options for puzzle fans who like a challenge. We included a wide array of designs — with actual photography, simple to complex illustrations, vibrant and more muted color palettes — as we know that every puzzle fan has different tastes. We also understand that the design can be a huge indication of how easy or challenging a puzzle ultimately is. If you’re not feeling our picks, we implore you to do some digging on these sites, as there are plenty of other great options! There’s nothing worse than opening a new puzzle to a ton of flimsy pieces, so the companies included on this list only use quality, thick material. Many also take advantage of recycled materials! While there are plenty of companies that sell puzzles as part of a broader catalog, we also focused on companies that primarily or exclusively make puzzles and puzzle accessories.

      "title": "Stay Cool and Confident with Halter Bikini Tops: Our Top Recommendations",
      "text": "Women of all shapes and sizes deserve to look and feel their best when they hit the beach. But finding the perfect swimsuit can be a challenge, especially when it comes to halter bikini tops. It’s important to find one that fits properly, provides the support you need, and looks great. To help you out, we’ve put together our top recommendations for halter bikini tops that will keep you cool and confident this summer. What is a Halter Bikini Top? Gorgeous halter bikini tops are a type of two-piece swimwear that ties around the neck in a “halter” style. It wraps around behind your neck before tying or clasping at the back or front of your neck. This style offers more support than other types of two-piece swimsuits, as it helps keep everything in place while providing an adjustable fit for maximum comfort. Benefits of Wearing Halter Bikini Tops Adjustable Fit: One of the main benefits of wearing halter bikinis is their adjustable fit. The straps can be tightened or loosened depending on how much coverage you want from your swimsuit, making it easy to get just the right amount of support without sacrificing style or comfort. Comfort: Another great perk about this style is its superior comfort level compared to other types of two-piece suits like string bikinis or bandeau tops which often dig into your skin and leave unsightly marks after long days spent in the sun! With its adjustable straps, halters provide a snug but comfortable fit, so you don’t have to worry about any embarrassing marks on those hot summer days. Supportive: Not only are these styles comfortable, but they also offer superior support compared to the other two pieces since they wrap around your body more securely than triangle bikinis do. The snugger fit also ensures everything stays where it should no matter what activities you’re engaged in, whether swimming laps in the pool or playing beach volleyball with friends. Stylish: Lastly, these styles are incredibly stylish too! Whether you prefer bold prints or solid colors, high-waisted bottoms, ruffles, or lace accents – there’s something out there for everyone. Plus, if you are ever unsure what size would work best for your body type – most stores offer free returns, so shopping online has never been easier! Our Top Recommendations Now that we’ve gone over some key features let’s take a look at our top recommendations for halters this season—time to get shopping, ladies! 1) Kona Sol Women’s Twist Front Halter Bikini Top: This classic twist front design from Kona Sol is sure to turn heads at any beach outing thanks to its eye-catching print options like florals & stripes. Along with this, the adjustable tie closures & removable padding inserts give added lift & shape without compromising on comfort levels either way! 2) Billabong Women’s High Neck Halter Bikini Top: If high necks are more up your alley, then check out Billabong’s offering – boasting supportive underwire cups & flexible boning throughout. This piece gives ample coverage while still maintaining an ultra-flattering silhouette regardless if worn alone or layered underneath tanks/tees as part of an ensemble alongside some denim shorts/skirts, perhaps. 3) Seafolly Women’s Lace Up Side Halter Swimsuit Top: Want something even more daring? Then why not try Seafolly’s lace-up side version, which takes things up another notch? Thanks not only due to its unique crisscross lacing detail down each side but also because it doubles as both bandeau & halter, depending on how tightly. 4) Roxy Women’s Off The Shoulder Tiered Ruffled Flounce Bralette Swimsuit Top: Last but certainly not least comes Roxy’s uber-chic off-shoulder option. This is completely made by cascading tiers upon tiers upon tiers of ruffles. Perfectly designed using stretchy fabrics which hug curves just right while still allowing plenty of room for movement. This particular piece quickly became one of our favorites here at HQ, given its undeniable sex appeal yet effortless sophistication. Conclusion We hope our list gave some insight into what makes halters such great choices when looking for stylish yet functional pieces during the warmer months ahead. So go forth, shop away, stay cool, stay confident. We know whatever choice is made will bring out the best self comes time to hit the sand dunes!

      "title": "Retired political science professor accused of stealing jewelry pleads not guilty in N.Y. court",
      "text": "A retired political science professor accused of stealing seven pieces of jewelry and selling them at auction pleaded not guilty to multiple charges Tuesday in a Manhattan criminal courtroom. Lawrence Gray, 79, a former professor at John Cabot University in Rome, is charged with one count of third-degree criminal possession of stolen property, one count of third-degree grand larceny and one count of first-degree scheming in order to defraud, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr.’s office said in a statement. Mr. Gray is accused of stealing three Buccellati pieces of luxury jewelry — a gold, silver and diamond brooch; a pair of gold, silver and diamond pendant earrings; and a two-color compact case jeweled in gold, cabochon rubies and diamonds — and four other pieces, according to court documents. The four pieces are a Verdura platinum, diamond and sapphire brooch, a Van Cleef & Arpels gold, cabochon ruby and diamond ring, an English-made pocket watch dating to the 19th century, and a pair of Oscar Heyman Brothers sapphire, emerald and diamond earclips, the court records said. Mr. Gray is accused of selling the seven stolen pieces with the Doyle Auctioneers and Appraisers auction house between 2016 and 2018, purportedly netting him over $45,000, prosecutors said. In addition to his not guilty plea, he entered the same plea in an ongoing Rhode Island criminal case where he is accused of stealing a $32,000 diamond and sapphire brooch from a wedding, according to Newport County Superior Court records, The Associated Press reported. The AP said he was the longtime romantic partner of the late Washington socialite Jacqueline Quillen and was subject to a lawsuit, now settled, that was filed by her sons. The next court hearing in the Rhode Island case is set for Sept. 7. Mr. Gray is due back in Manhattan criminal court on Halloween.",

Shaun McKenna 00:08 Welcome to Deep Dive from The Japan Times, I’m Shaun McKenna. Four years ago, I made my debut on this podcast, then hosted by Oscar Boyd as he recorded my first ever trek up Mount Fuji. Oscar Boyd 00:21 Shaun McKenna, you’re standing at the top of Mount Fuji in 2 degrees temperature, ferocious winds. Do you remember how we got here? Shaun McKenna 00:31 I, I don’t know. I don’t know if I can remember anything right now. Shaun McKenna 00:36 The climb was thrilling, challenging and definitely one of the highlights of my time here in Japan. The peak is 3,776 meters high, and it’s an active volcano. So the hike is not a walk in the park by any means. Though every year people of all ages attempt the ascent between the beginning of July and into mid September. This year in particular, with COVID-19 measures easing and the borders opening to international tourists, it seems like everyone is attempting the ascent. So much so that authorities are warning crowd control is needed to manage the numbers. This week, Japan Times contributing writer Drew Damron joins us to discuss Fuji’s crowds, climbing alternatives and other aspects of the adventure tourism that Japan has to offer. And after we speak to Drew we’ll welcome Japan Times culture writer Patrick St. Michel to the podcast to talk about Japan’s other famous Fuji, this weekend’s Fuji Rock Festival. Drew, welcome to Deep Dive. Drew Damron 01:38 Yeah, thanks for having me. Shaun McKenna 01:39 I guess the first question I’ll ask is, I know you from your writing as doing some pretty athletic activities in Japan. But have you ever actually climbed Mount Fuji? Drew Damron 01:48 I did. Yeah, I did in 2017. Shaun McKenna 01:51 How many times have you climbed it? Drew Damron 01:52 Just the one time. May be going out again soon. But yeah, for now, I’ve just climbed it once. Shaun McKenna 01:58 What was the experience like? Drew Damron 02:00 It was fun. My best friend had come to visit me and we both decided to go challenge the mountain. And that was before I really got into regular hiking and trail running. But yeah, it was, it was a really unique experience. And the mountain landscape is very different from a lot of other places that I had been. Just kind of more volcanic soil and scrubby-type plants around. And I remember being up at a pretty high elevation and looking out over the clouds and seeing a distant storm with like lightning flashing. And being above the lightning and watching the storm like below me. That was when we were staying at the hut and I was really pretty. Yeah. And Shaun, you climbed it for this podcast, right? Shaun McKenna 02:40 I did. I thought it was a fantastic experience. Definitely a challenge. I’m really not a hiker or a climber. Well, I wasn’t before Fuji. But I sincerely recommend it to anyone who’s thinking of coming to Japan or who already lives here. Drew Damron 02:55 Yeah, it’s definitely a unique experience. And it’s an important icon for Japan and the people who live here. When I climbed, I didn’t go straight up the mountain. I stayed at the eighth hut on the Fujinomiya trail on the south side of the mountain, and then woke up about three in the morning and caught the sunrise at the top. Shaun McKenna 03:14 OK, we took a break as well. I am pretty sure we climbed the Fujinomiya Trail, which is like a little tougher, but shorter. Is that right? Drew Damron 03:23 Yes. Steeper but quicker to the top. Yeah. Shaun McKenna 03:25 And then we rested at the 9.5 station cabin. And actually, that’s a good segue into today’s topic. The cabins on the mountain are all apparently booked already this season. And that’s causing concern that visitors may attempt something called “dangan tozan,” which is bullet climbing. Drew, can you explain a little to us what bullet climbing is? Drew Damron 03:48 Yeah, so this term for bullet climbing, it’s particularly used for climbing Mount Fuji. But it’s essentially going straight from the base area up to the top without stopping to rest or like acclimatize to the elevation as well. Yeah, it’s a popular way to climb up. But it only accounts for maybe less than 10% of the number of climbers who actually go up Mount Fuji. But the concern is that with so many people booking out and these huts that are already reducing the number of people who can stay, the capacity is lower and more people coming still want to climb up and so they may be resorting to this bullet climb technique of going straight up to the top. And while there are people who do it, it’s risky in that if you’ve never been up to that kind of elevation, you don’t really know how you’re going to experience the altitude if it’s going to affect you pretty significantly or not. And there’s just a lot of risks with the increased number of tourists and climbers coming as well as the decreased capacity of the huts’ occupancy. Shaun McKenna 04:47 What kind of risks are involved with climbing Fuji? Drew Damron 04:49 The first one is altitude sickness. Generally that can kick in in anywhere above 2,500 meters and Fuji’s summit is at 3,700. So it’s quite high, and the air gets thinner as you go up. And it’s hard to know how you may respond to that. Another one is simply just slipping or twisting your ankle. The trail is very gravelly up towards the top as it’s kind of volcanic-type rocks. And a lot of times that people are rushing up to catch the sunrise at the summit. And that just kind of increases the chance of slipping and twisting something. And then also being up at that high altitude, it’s very cold, and there is a concern about hypothermia if you’re not particularly prepared. And even though the climbing season is in July, and August, which are the hottest months of the summer, a general rule of thumb is like every 100 meters up, it’s one degree colder. And so, at more than 3,000, it can be close to zero degrees on occasion, even during the summertime. Shaun McKenna 05:46 Actually, when I climbed Fuji, I overprepared, somewhat. But I was definitely warm until it started raining. And then yeah, then I wasn’t. But when I descended the mountain, we took the easier Yoshida trail for the descent. And I saw people wearing jeans and sandals and like no other equipment. Drew Damron 06:07 Yeah, definitely make sure that you do your research. And the Yoshida trail is maybe three times more popular than the other trails around. So a lot more people take that approach up, and it is generally more accessible and a longer time, but it’s not as steep. But yeah, I also saw people in jeans going up and was wondering how they’re going to be up at the top. I guess as long as you don’t linger, and you really kind of hustle then it’s fine. But yeah, it’s very risky. And another thing that the authorities are worried about is that if the number of people are expected to be climbing are higher, and they’re basing this off of the number of reservations, but there are like laser gates on these trails that are counting it. And it looks like as of now there’s a 40% increase of the number of climbers on the mountain this year. And all of those extra people on the trail are kind of knocking rocks loose, and there’s a concern of rock slides and trail damage as well in a conservation aspect. Shaun McKenna 07:01 Are the authorities doing anything other than just warning people not to bullet climb up Mount Fuji? A warning that I imagine a lot of tourists aren’t going to hear. Drew Damron 07:11 Yeah, and there are some articles that are being translated into English. But for the most part, there’s a call to try to refrain from the bullet climb. There are talks and I think they are reducing the hours of accessibility to the Subaru Line, which is the road that goes up to the fifth station on the Yoshida trail that used to be open 24 hours and now they close it at night to try to discourage people from going up. But they really can’t impose restrictions on what the people can do. But Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures, which kind of share the mountain, are putting these calls out. And I think a lot of that is out of concern for the huts’ staff as well. Because when accidents like this do happen, the people managing and working at the huts are the ones who are going out to provide first aid or trying to bring people in. And if they’re trying to take care of the people staying in the hut and run those operations and go out at the same time then it is risky, all of the chance of incidents rises. So just before you come, be prepared and do your research. Shaun McKenna 08:22 Drew, you recently wrote a piece for The Japan Times titled “Five climbs around Tokyo to get your Mount Fuji fix.” Did the problems we discussed in the first segment influence that by any chance? Drew Damron 08:33 It did in a way. And I also think that Japan has a lot of beautiful hikes around, and a lot of tourists who come fixate on Fuji and one of the best things about climbing around Japan is having that view of Fuji from the top, too. So I really wanted to highlight all of these other great mountains that are nearby that are easier to get to and maybe don’t exacerbate this issue that the prefectures are dealing with on Mount Fuji. Shaun McKenna 08:55 Getting a shot of Fuji in the background is always great for your social media accounts. What were the mountains you chose for the piece, and how did you go about choosing those particular ones? Drew Damron 09:06 So I had to narrow it down to five. I chose to feature Bonomine and Tonodake and Mount Kumotori, Mount Akadake and Mount Yarigatake. I chose to feature them and curate them kind of a level of easier to access to more difficult classic climbs. Bonomine is great because it takes you through this really beautiful, like, waterfall surrounded gorge through these like deep ferns and in a very sanctuary feeling — very Ghibli movie down in there. And so that one’s not necessarily about getting up to the top although the view is quite nice but that there are beautiful views along the way that are refreshing during the summertime. Tonodake, I chose, that was kind of the first mountain that I climbed that really made me fall in love with hiking. And there’s just a really beautiful view of the mountains and in between that peak and Mount Fuji with Fuji kind of dominating the horizon there. It’s really, really beautiful. Kumotori is the highest mountain in Tokyo Prefecture. And that one is pretty easy to get to by public transportation. And it’s one of the hyakumeizan, which is a kind of list of the 100 famous mountains in Japan. And so, that one’s quite interesting to go up and experience and see that monument there. Akadake is a part of the Yatsugatake, which is like an eight-peaked mountain that’s in Nagano. So it’s a little bit further away, but that one is very much like the classic hiking area since like the ’50s here in Japan. So it’s really been the place where people cut their teeth and start to prepare for alpining. And then Mount Yarigatake is one of the iconic peaks of Kamikochi, which is sort of like Japan’s Yosemite Valley. It’s one of the most beautiful places in Japan, and Yarigatake, which means “Spear Peak” is one of the most iconic peaks in Japan as well. It’s a long approach, there is some pretty sketchy climbing in the last 20 minutes where you’re scrambling up pitons and ladders and you’re pretty exposed. But that is the classic hike and it’s kind of one of those where you can say that you’ve climbed Mount Fuji, and that’s one thing, but if you’ve climbed Yarigatake, that’s really something else. Shaun McKenna 11:16 Right, right. Bonomine, that’s 969 meters. So that’s still much higher than Tokyo Sky Tree, which is 634 meters. Is it OK for a beginner to kind of take that one on? Drew Damron 11:29 One thing you have to consider is the starting elevation, too. And so, starting that hike, you’re already around 400 meters. So it’s about 500 meters up, which is kind of an average beginner hike. It’s about a two-hour approach. And I think that as you’re going through that waterfall gorge, you’re not really feeling that taxing hike as much because it’s just so pretty around you. But, yeah, there are other ones like Mount Takao or Mount Tsukuba that are nearby that are much more popular. But Mount Takao has a, there’s a chairlift going up to the top and it’s paved sidewalk along the way. Shaun McKenna 12:04 Isn’t there a beer garden at the top? Drew Damron 12:05 There’s a beer garden. There’s ice cream up the summit too and it’s a great mountain and very popular as well. And a very old shrine. Very historically important area for the Shugendo kind of yamabushi practicing monks out there as well. Shaun McKenna 12:20 Is it possible that like a good hike isn’t always one that comes with some kind of superlative attached to it? So like, you don’t need to necessarily climb the highest mountain in Saitama or, you know, the place with the most spectacular view of Tokyo? Drew Damron 12:35 Yeah, yeah, of course. I mean, there’s that list of the hyakumeizan that I mentioned is the 100 famous mountains of Japan. But there’s a lot of mountains on that list that people question like, “Why are they even on there?” No beautiful view. It was a long approach along kind of a dirt access road. And there’s thousands of trails in Japan. And it could take you years if you did a different one every weekend. So there’s a lot of different kinds of views and valleys to explore. And, you know, sometimes you don’t get that payoff at the top, and even if you’re expecting it, sometimes it’s cloudy and you don’t get any view at all. So just go out and try different things ... and one thing that I’ve recently come to enjoy is that there’s this concept of the “yama no kokoro,” or the heart of the mountain. And a lot of times with hiking and trail running, the payoff is the summit and the view from the top. But there’s something about getting deep into the valley where that clean, crisp stream is going through with the fish and there’s deer everywhere and there’s thick moss and these really deep, beautiful parts of the mountain that are the source of water that’s going down to the irrigation and the towns. And that’s another really special type of beauty here in Japan that can also satisfy something aesthetically that the summits can’t quite do, I think. Shaun McKenna 13:56 Have you checked out any trails in other parts of the country? Drew Damron 13:59 I have been out to Kamikochi, that’s in deep Nagano area. I’ve been hiking around Tohoku up in Iwate. It’s a pretty, kind of low-altitude highlands area, but really deep, beautiful part of the country. Hokkaido is great as well, and Kyoto has some really nice hiking around that city as well. Shaun McKenna 14:22 So another story that you wrote that I really liked was on sawanobori. Can you explain to us what sawanobori is? Drew Damron 14:29 Yeah, so sawanobori is this kind of niche type of rock climbing that’s only done in Japan. And that’s climbing up the streams and the mountains and climbing up the waterfalls. For some people, they may know canyoning and canyoning is kind of descending down. But here in Japan, they’re actually climbing up. And I think it’s done in Japan it started out with like fishermen trying to ascend these to find trout and the freshwater fish, and it changed a bit more with the kind of golden age of climbing in Japan that was like in the 20s, where people started to go and climb for submitting the peaks, whereas before it was maybe the realm of the gods and unless you were yamabushi accessing these areas. Shaun McKenna 15:11 So I know kami means “gods.” I wonder, this is the second time you’ve said yamabushi, what are “yamabushi”? Drew Damron 15:15 Yamabushi, it’s a type of like Shinto follower and as a part of their religious practice, and as a part of their meditation and prayer, they would hike up to the top of these mountains. I don’t know if you’ve seen them. They have these sandals, and they blow the conch shells. And they kind of have these long noses that look like the tengu spirits that live out in the mountains. They were developing some trails up along the top, but during the golden age of hiking, and people trying to just go up in the alpine style, like the Europeans and trying to reach the summits, the streams were usually the way that’s more clear and not quite as steep. And you didn’t have to hack through and build your own trails. And it provided water access. You could get water along the way. And you could get your fish along the way, too. And so, these trout fishermen would use gear like the waraji, so like these, these woven straw sandals to help them grip the stone as they go up. And so the hikers would start to use them too. And then along comes rock climbing, where people can start to apply climbing gear to climb these waterfalls and get deeper into these valleys. And so it kind of evolved into this exciting adventure sport, where you’re deep in the mountains in the summertime, it’s really hot, but you’re cooling off in the stream, and you’re climbing up these waterfalls, and you’re applying rock-climbing skills, but you’re also hiking and swimming in these deep pools, foraging for mushrooms, and you’re fishing and camping and you’re in wetsuits just kind of pulled from like rafting as well. And so it’s this interesting, like kind of emerging holistic activity that’s done here in Japan and nowhere else. And another part of that, too, is that Japan has a relatively young landmass, geologically speaking. So it’s, it’s kind of small, but has these really steep mountains and the rivers in Japan are quite unique and that they’re very short and very steep when compared to a lot of other rivers around the world. And so that makes them very conducive for climbing up. Shaun McKenna 17:07 Right? Where did you do this sawanobori? Drew Damron 17:09 I often go in Chichibu, in Okuchichibu area. It’s also done in Tanzawa, kind of northeastern Yamanashi Prefecture as well. That’s where supposedly that’s kind of where sawanobori started. Was in like, where Yamanashi connects up into Chichibu area. But you can also go out in Nagano, the Southern Alps, and it’s quite popular in Hokkaido as well. And it’s starting to occur in Taiwan and New Zealand as well, which are other kind of mountainous island areas. But in the summertime, it’s really hot outside, it’s a great way to cool off and still practice your climbing skills. Shaun McKenna 17:43 So if someone wants to, if someone listens to this and wants to try it, where would they start, where’s the best place to start? Drew Damron 17:48 There are some approachable streams for climbing and Okutama that are just off of the bus line if you’re heading out to Lake Okutama. Around Takao there are some streams too. And it’s possible to just walk in the stream and kind of hike up along your way and cool off that way. It doesn’t necessarily require climbing up waterfalls, but there are some accessible ones there. Okuchichibu are a bit more dangerous. And actually, I broke my hand last year doing it. That was kind of where the story came from. Shaun McKenna 18:15 So you’ve written about other outdoor activities. Were you always into this kind of adventure travel before you came to Japan? Drew Damron 18:23 No, no. So Michigan, where I grew up, is totally flat. So I never knew this about myself that I liked mountains so much until I came here. But it was kind of like a lot of other people during the pandemic. A lot of stuff was closed and there wasn’t much to do. And I was getting a bit stir crazy in my apartment, and I went out and started hiking and I found it to be really what I needed at the time. And that turned into trail running and trail running turned into ultra marathons. And then rock climbing turned into ice climbing and then waterfall climbing and skiing in the wintertime. I think that’s one thing that’s really nice about Japan is that not only do you have the mountains, but you have all these seasons with these unique activities, too. So you know, in the fall, you’re out doing multipitch climbing on rock faces, and then excited for winter when it comes because that means ice climbing. Shaun McKenna 19:08 Is there anything along these lines that you’d like to do that you haven’t done yet? Drew Damron 19:13 I think just getting out and getting more experience with the gear. Ice climbing is a relatively short season here in Japan, and that seems to be getting shorter with climate change as well. So just trying to get more comfortable with the gear and trying to set up good lead routes for my partners, whereas usually I’m the one following them. But for now, the next kind of big activity that I’m planning for is a wedding. So wedding planning is the new ultra marathon that I’m working on. Shaun McKenna 19:38 Right. Well congratulations on that and good luck with it. Thanks Drew very much for coming on Deep Dive. Drew Damron 19:44 Yeah, of course. Thanks for having me. Shaun McKenna 19:52 So we’ve talked about Mount Fuji. Now, we’re here to talk to Japan Times culture writer Patrick St. Michel about a different kind of Fuji. Patrick St. Michel 20:00 Yes, Fuji Rock. Shaun McKenna 20:02 Fuji Rock indeed. So this is one of Japan’s biggest outdoor music festivals, and it’s most well-known internationally. It takes place this weekend, July 28 to 30. This year is probably going to be different, right? Because overseas tourism is back. Tell us a bit about what happened to Fuji Rock over the pandemic. Patrick St. Michel 20:21 Sure thing. So like many events and festivals in 2020, Fuji Rock was, air quotes here, “postponed” in 2020. That was really just PR talk for “canceled.” They just didn’t want to make it look like they had given up on an entire year. So there was no music festivals at all in 2020, let alone one of the biggest in the country. In 2021, they decided to try an experiment. During this time, there were still, you know, numbers were still relatively high in Japan, we had all sorts of COVID variants running wild and, most importantly, the borders were still closed. So foreign artists, who traditionally are some of the biggest pulls for people who are going out to Fuji Rock every year, they couldn’t play. So to put on an event, they decided we have to have an all-Japanese lineup. This is the first time they’ve ever done that, and it was a neat little experiment that, you know, got some good press but also came about at this weird time for the live music industry where there’s just a ton of media scrutiny on festivals like Fuji Rock, or even their main sort of competitor in the space, Summer Sonic. Shaun McKenna 21:42 Because they were kind of seeing these concerts as superspreader events, right? Patrick St. Michel 21:46 Yes. And there were actually a few notable attempts at festivals that summer in 2021, most notably a rap festival in Nagoya, Nami Monogatari, that was documented on social media as: “Nobody was wearing masks,” “Everybody was drinking,” “Social distancing? What’s that? They didn’t know!” So everyone got super angry at that event, and it really impacted every other festival. So yeah, the media in particular and social media users were kind of looking for things to ding any summer events. And Fuji Rock was actually the first major festival after that Nagoya event. So they were especially under the spotlight, but they got through it. Everything was OK. Shaun McKenna 22:31 So now we’re back to normal Fuji Rock. Let’s talk a little about who’s playing normal Fuji Rock, let’s start with the headliners. The acts playing the main Green Stage, we have The Strokes, Foo Fighters and Lizzo. What do you think of these choices for headliners? Patrick St. Michel 22:48 The first two, the Friday headliner The Strokes and Saturday headliner Foo Fighters, are very traditional-ish Fuji Rock headliners. Shaun McKenna 22:56 In that they’re rock bands. Patrick St. Michel 22:57 Exactly. It’s right in the name. So, Foo Fighters have headlined in the recent past just a few years ago. I remember it was whenever Dave Grohl, the lead singer of the group, had broken his foot. So it was a big thing where he was, like, sitting the whole time, but still soldiered through it. The Strokes have never headlined Fuji Rock, they’ve headlined other Japanese festivals, but they’re a perfect fit. They’re an early 2000s rock band, so there’s the perfect mix for aging rock fans to come out and be like, “I remember that.” Those two make perfect sense for Fuji Rock. One of the dilemmas that has faced Fuji Rock, and honestly all music festivals around the world, is trying to find the next wave, if you will, of headlining festival acts. And in Japan in particular, it’s been tough for the international ones who often lean on these like familiar ’90s names. So that’s what makes Sunday’s headliner, Lizzo, so interesting. She’s an American pop star who came to prominence in 2018, maybe 2019? She was one of the first artists I can remember that was really pushed forward thanks to TikTok. She’s a very charismatic performer, dabbles in a variety of genre, but she’s a real example of a very 21st-century pop star, let’s say, the sort of act that doesn’t typically headline Fuji Rock. So it feels like a real effort to see, like, hey, can this performer stick, you know? And Lizzo has developed a decent following in Japan. She’s part of a major label of course, and they’ve promoted her over the years. And yeah, they are hoping this is like the start of a new era, a new star who can be part of Fuji Rock moving forward. Shaun McKenna 24:47 Additionally, the sub-headliners — so Daniel Caesar, Ellegarden and Bad Hop — out of these acts, personally, I’d be really interested in catching Daniel Caesar. He’s a Canadian R&B singer who will be promoting his new album “Never Enough.” And there’s this whole setup with the timetable where you can catch Tohji, a Japanese rapper on the White Stage, head over to the Green Stage for Daniel Caesar, and if you’re not up for The Strokes, you can head back over to the White Stage for Denzel Curry and NxWorries. That seems to be the more Gen Z approach to Friday, whereas millennials may want to do the Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs at the Red Marquee before hitting up The Strokes. Patrick St. Michel 25:27 So yeah, you have a real chance to revisit your Brooklyn youth that you imagined in 2002. I would probably personally go for that Gen Z route, because that’s a really interesting trio of artists you mentioned and it actually also reflects one of the other developments playing out at Fuji Rock. It started a couple years ago, but it feels very pronounced this year, which is a greater emphasis on rap music, especially Japanese rap. You mentioned Tohji, who’s a really, like, up-and-coming, almost genreless kind of performer, but rooted in rap. He’s a real firecracker. But one of the biggest additions that came very late at Fuji Rock, actually, I believe, as a way to replace Lewis Capaldi ... replacing him is the Kanagawa rap group Bad Hop, who have been one of the most popular and influential rap groups in Japan over the 2010s. They are currently on their last tour ever. They will officially disband in September, I believe. And they’ve had a very interesting career, they’re kind of a good representation of 2010s-era Japanese rap, which is drawing a lot from American rap, especially like Atlanta-born sounds, but also kind of interpreting it in a Japanese way. And funny enough, they actually were the headlining act of that Nagoya festival we talked about earlier, that was such a media flurry, and they got in trouble because of that and that threw their career off for like two years. So this final tour is almost like a final hurrah for them after this weird period where they became, not quite scapegoats, but received quite unfair criticism when it was really an organizer’s fault. It’s also the type of rap music you usually don’t see at Fuji Rock, especially on the Green Stage. When I think of, like, Green Stage hip hop, I’m thinking like the Beastie Boys or Eminem. Shaun McKenna 27:38 Yeah, I was thinking Jurassic 5. Patrick St. Michel 27:40 That’s yeah, it’s very, “let’s throw it back,” which is great in its own way. But this is very 2010s, very Gen Z — as we talked about — very like, “this is what young people in Japan are listening to.” I sound like a grandpa saying that ... but it’s OK. It’s true. And it’s really interesting that they’re that high up. And I think it’ll be a really interesting not just a musical milestone for the group, their first time performing at Fuji Rock, but also a really interesting evolution for the festival itself, as it kind of faces a new audience and tries to figure out what kind of artists are going to get the kids out here. Like, it’s such a pain for a young person to get up to Niigata and find somewhere to stay. So like, you got to find the artists who are worth it. And I think they might be a good test case to see, you know, if we bring these type of rappers out, is this gonna stick? Kind of alter the way the lineup is constructed moving forward. Shaun McKenna 28:36 In terms of Japanese bands, are there any others that you’d suggest checking out at Fuji this year? Patrick St. Michel 28:42 Oh, definitely. I think this is a good year to kind of get a sense of the next wave of Japanese rock artists and also forward-thinking creators, for lack of a better term. Maybe the biggest name plays the White Stage Saturday night. That’s the artist Vaundy, a rock artist who over the past four or five years has become one of the most prominent young artists in the country. Their songs are just always on, like, Spotify Top 50 Japan lists. Beyond that, some good bands to check out: Hitsujibungaku, on the Green Stage, is a real up-and-coming name making this really slow burning cinematic rock. A long running, indie pop band that I am a personal fan of, Homecomings, plays the White Stage on the weekend, great band. Shaun McKenna 29:39 I think that’s on Sunday. Patrick St. Michel 29:40 Sunday ... Thank you. Thank you for having the schedule up Shaun. Last, in terms of Japanese artists, I highly recommend — even if you don’t go to the festival, check this person out — Hakushi Hasegawa, who is an electronic producer. They’re playing Saturday on the Red stage at night. This week, actually yesterday, it was announced that they’ve signed with Brainfeeder, the prominent electronic label in LA — home to Flying Lotus and a bunch of other prominent experimental electronic artists. They’re the first Japanese artists to ever be signed to this label and they are fantastic. Just this absolute blitzkrieg of like, electronic sounds mixed with jazz, mixed with piano fusion, mixed with inspiration from Disney ballads. It’s great, highly recommend it, real forward, like, this is the future and you want to listen. Shaun McKenna 30:30 How about non-Japanese acts? Patrick St. Michel 30:31 The one that jumped out to me the most is the South Korean band, Balming Tiger. They are, on paper, a rock band, sort of a traditional collective of people playing with instruments, you know, but they’re also very freewheeling and open to smashing in other styles, whether it’s rap, electronic elements, whatever. They’re very high energy and they ... I’ve never seen them, but based on YouTube videos I’ve seen, put on a really like nearly chaotic show. So I think that’ll be really fun. Shaun McKenna 31:07 So Fuji Rock is the closest thing Japan kind of has to something like Glastonbury or Coachella. Summer Sonic also produces good lineups. This year, it has Blur, Fall Out Boy, Liam Gallagher and Kendrick Lamar headlining. But apart from the main stadium stage, Summer Sonic is usually held indoors and then, like, Fuji Rock is all outdoors. So what are some other things that people should do if they check out Fuji Rock this year? Patrick St. Michel 31:33 Fuji Rock is always a great chance just to kind of soak yourself in nature. As somebody who’s not a big fan of the outdoor world, even I can appreciate how beautiful Naeba — the little ski resort town where this plays out in — is in the summer. Just lots of trees all around you, lots of rivers running through. I’d recommend anyone who goes there, especially if it’s your first time, just spend some time going off the proverbial beaten path. Whether that’s kind of like just wandering from one end of the festival to the other to kind of take in the entire terrain. Or, my biggest recommendation is just shell out the, I think, ¥1,000 to get the little gondola pass that takes you up to the ... there’s a stage up in the mountains basically ... you have to take like a 15-minute gondola ride to get up there. But it’s gorgeous, a great place to just relax. There’s usually lots of good downtempo electronic music so you can zone out. So I’d recommend you know taking some time out of the usual, like, “I have to see this, I have to see that” and instead just enjoying the scenery because that is ultimately what makes Fuji Rock so special. Shaun McKenna 32:43 All right, well, Fuji Rock will take place this weekend, July 28 to 30 at Naeba Ski Resort in Niigata Prefecture. And if you don’t make that one, Summer Sonic will take place in Tokyo and Osaka over the weekend of Aug. 19 and 20. Patrick, thanks very much for coming back on Deep Dive. Patrick St. Michel 33:00 Thank you for having me. I’ll be camping at Fuji Rock this year. If you see somebody lost and hopeless please help them, it’s probably me. Shaun McKenna 33:11 My thanks again to both Patrick St. Michel and Drew Damron for joining me",

      "title": "Unlike Her Wedding to King Charles, Camilla Parker Bowles Was Allowed to Wear a Tiara the First Time She Got Married",
      "text": "As a member of the royal family, Camilla Parker Bowles is well-acquainted with the sparkle of tiaras. However, departing from the traditional royal wedding norms, she chose not to sport a tiara when she exchanged vows with King Charles. In contrast, during her first wedding back in the 70s, Camilla did adorn an exquisite tiara. Here’s a closer look at Camilla’s bridal headpiece and why she opted out of wearing it for her second marriage ceremony. Camilla Parker Bowles wore this tiara for her first wedding in 1973 In 2005, when Camilla tied the knot with Charles, she opted to forego the traditional tiara. However, during her first nuptials, she did choose to adorn one. Camilla first pledged her vows to Andrew Parker Bowles back in 1973. They conducted their marriage ceremony in the Roman Catholic tradition, with the festivities continuing into a reception held at St. James’s Palace. In her wedding ensemble, Camilla dazzled in a white dress with a distinctive pie crust collar, full-length sleeves, and a ruffle skirt. An exceptionally remarkable piece of jewelry — a diamond tiara, dubbed the Cubitt-Shand tiara — completed her bridal look. This exquisite diamond headpiece, boasting a floral design interspersed with leaf sprays, carries the legacy of her family. Its name pays tribute to Camilla’s grandfather, Roland Cubitt, who bequeathed this stunning piece to her grandmother, Rosalind, and her father, Major Bruce Shand. Diamond experts estimate the value of the Queen’s tiara Upon the passing of her grandmother in 1986, Camilla came into possession of the Cubitt-Shand tiara. She is not the sole family member who donned this stunning piece for their wedding. When her daughter Laura Lopes walked down the aisle with Harry Lopes in 2006, she too borrowed this magnificent adornment. This exceptional headpiece holds a special place in Camilla’s collection, as she has worn it on many occasions. One noteworthy instance was at a formal reception at the Royal Academy of the Arts in June 2015. According to jeweler Maxwell Stone, an expert on diamonds from Steven Stone, estimates this tiara’s value is jaw-dropping. “Clearly fond of the piece, Queen Camilla has worn it to various events over the years,” Stone explained. “I’d estimate the intricate piece to be worth $385,000.” Although Camilla has a strong attachment to this iconic tiara, she chose not to wear it at her wedding when she became Charles’s wife. It turns out Camilla had a good reason for omitting the tiara. This is why Camilla Parker Bowles didn’t wear a tiara at her wedding to King Charles Typically, tiaras are a central accessory at royal weddings. However, eagle-eyed royal fans noted that Camilla opted out of this shimmering tradition for her marriage to King Charles. On the day of their union, Camilla broke away from the conventional, choosing two distinct ensembles designed by Anna Valentine and Antonia Robinson. Complementing both outfits, Camilla chose to accentuate her look with headpieces designed by Philip Treacy. And there could be a pair of reasons for this choice. First and foremost, it was not Camilla’s debut at the altar. Drawing a parallel, Princess Anne also decided against a tiara for her second wedding with Sir Timothy Laurence in 1992. Another reason could is the nature of the ceremony itself. Camilla and Charles had a civil wedding at Windsor Guildhall rather than a traditional church ceremony. They followed that up with a marriage blessing at St George’s Chapel.",

      "title": "Artist Todd Goldman files $55M suit against ex-pal, businessman for 'stealing' hundreds of paintings",
      "text": "Prolific pop-artist Todd Goldman claims an ex-pal and a businessman conned him out of hundreds of his pieces — which they then copied and sold, diluting his brand, according to a new $55 million lawsuit. Goldman – who’s sold works to celebrities like Paul McCartney, Rihanna and Leonardo DiCaprio – accuses art dealer and one-time pal Eli Weisman and Roy Revivo, a California businessman, of taking advantage of him when he was struggling financially in order to steal his works, the lawsuit states. The alleged scam started after Goldman, 55, confided in Weisman about his expensive divorce and custody battle and turned to the art dealer for help paying his legal bills in 2016, according to the suit, filed Thursday in Manhattan federal court. Weisman, who runs the fine art gallery and auction house Q-Art, linked the California-based artist up with Revivo, who gave him two loans in 2016 and 2017 using his works as collateral, the suit alleges. When the first loan of $40,000 came due in 2017, Goldman couldn’t repay the money “and elected instead to allow Revivo to keep” the 2,500 “outdated” and signed lithographs he’d put up collateral, the suit claims. Revivo made almost $100,000 off of those works, the court papers say. In March 2017, Goldman needed more cash for the divorce proceedings, so he and Revivo worked out a deal where Goldman would get a $100,000 loan backed by 800 of his paintings — worth $3.5 million, according to the lawsuit. Revivo asked to inspect the works before he signed any contract with Goldman, transporting the pieces from Florida to California and giving Goldman a $10,000 advance in the meantime “as a sign of good faith,” the court papers allege. But Goldman saw that the works were being stored in a truck “in extreme heat” without air conditioning, causing them to stick together and become ruined. He also began to lose lucrative deals because the works were being held “hostage” — and told Revivo he’d return the $10,000 to get the pieces back, the suit claims. Revivo, however, allegedly changed the terms of the loan — telling Goldman he’d need to pay more to have the artworks returned, according to the suit. He first increased the repayment amount to $25,000, and then to $50,000, effectively making it impossible for Goldman to get his works back, the suit claims. “Roy and Defendants had no intention of returning the pieces of art to Todd, it/they/he/she intended on taking advantage of Todd’s being distracted and financially strapped due to his divorce, to execute the perfect con job against Plaintiff,” the suit charges. “Meanwhile time was passing and Todd was losing millions of business opportunities with his art.” While Revivo had his art, Goldman claims he lost out on a lucrative deal for the works to be bought by a cruise line and another deal to sell the works in Europe – costing him millions, the suit allges. Goldman eventually declared bankruptcy in 2018, and Revivo and Weisman allegedly started copying the works, making giclees — or fine prints of paintings — and selling them online, the suit claims. The cheap reproductions were offered up for “for fire sale prices” — without the artist’s permission — saturating the market and leaving Goldman with almost no more business opportunities, while his brand became destroyed and “watered down,” according to the suit. “Defendants in this action knew full well the popularity of Todd’s work, and like a Trojan Horse, offered Todd help when he was down and needed it the most, but with sinister and egregious intentions,” the filing claims. Goldman’s lawyer Victor Feraru told The Post, “This is one of the most egregious cases of exploiting an artist’s work that I have ever seen.” “The Defendants in this case single-handedly diluted the market with unauthorized reproductions of my client’s work and committed unthinkable fraud in the most vindictive and morally corrupt ways possible,” Feraru said. “We look forward to this case making its way to a jury.” Goldman, who’s had clothing brands and television shows based on his “cartoonish” pop-art paintings, is suing the pair and Weisman’s art company Q-Art for $55 million. Weisman told The Post that “it’s a completely falsehood” that he and Revivo produced fake copies of Goldman’s works. Over Q-Art’s 17 years doing business, the company has only ever been issued three demand letters, which were all from Goldman, “during his divorce, during his bankruptcy, and this latest attempted extortion, which began in 2021 when his then attorney demanded $10,000,000 within 7 days,” Weisman said. Weisman forwarded The Post his letter in response to the demand for $10 million that he sent to Goldman’s lawyer. “Qart.com has never reproduced Todd Goldman’s paintings nor have we reproduced his signature,” the letter said, adding that any reproductions they had were published by prior company that worked with Goldman. “Even a shallow dive would clear it up,” Weisman said in the letter. The letter also said that Quality Art Auctions was selling Goldman’s works since 2009 and that “no major” changes in the business dealings had occurred in that time. “Todd clearly was aware of what pieces sold for because he received payments and reports of every transaction and chose to deliver additional art on many occasions over the years,” the letter said. Weisman also said his company “had no financial benefit in the dealings between Roy and Todd,” adding, “I introduced them as a courtesy.” Revivo didn’t return a request for comment Thursday.",

      "text": "AUCKLAND : Sweden's rich run of goals from set pieces saw them squeeze out a 2-1 victory over Japan on Friday to set them up for a semi-final against Spain as they continue their chase for a long-awaited first World Cup triumph. Faced with one of the most formidable teams left in the tournament, Sweden dug deep in their bag of dead-ball tricks and, though they did not execute them as cleanly as in previous games, it was still enough to see them through. A scramble after a free kick saw Amanda Ilestedt score her fourth goal of the tournament - all coming from set pieces - and a Jonna Andersson corner was handled in the box, allowing Filippa Angeldahl to rifle home the resulting penalty. \"What's going on? It's completely crazy, completely crazy,\" Ilestedt told Swedish radio when asked about her red-hot scoring streak. \"I'm happy as long as we're winning, but it's fun that the ball is going in too.\" Sweden's dead-ball set-ups are often decided by assistant coach Magnus Wikman, who spends hours poring over ideas and then patiently drilling them with his players. That collective effort has been their greatest source of success at the tournament - eight of their 11 goals coming from set pieces, either directly or after opponents failed to clear. The Swedes successfully smothered Japan's fast-paced passing game in midfield. The Japanese side's best chances also came from set pieces but they missed a penalty and saw a free kick strike the bar and bounce on the line before spinning away. Japan pulled a goal back in the 87th minute but it was too little, too late as Peter Gerhardsson's Sweden side played the percentages perfectly once again to set up a semi-final against Spain next Tuesday. In doing so, the Swedes knocked out the 2011 champions and with the United States, Germany and Norway having already gone home, they ensured that whoever wins this enthralling World Cup will do so for the first time in their history. Sweden's best result at the finals came in 2003, when they lost to Germany in the final, but this time they are aiming to go one better. \"Obviously we're not happy with a semi-final, we want to go the whole way,\" team captain Kosovare Asllani said. \"I believe strongly in my team and we'll be more than ready for Tuesday.\"",

      "title": "The state of China&#8217;s generative AI",
      "text": "Kaiser Kuo: Welcome to the Sinica Podcast, a weekly discussion of current affairs in China, produced in partnership with The China Project. Subscribe to Access from The China Project to get, well, access. Access to not only our great newsletter, the Daily Dispatch, but to all of the original writing on our website at thechinaproject.com. We’ve got reported stories, essays and editorials, great explainers, regular columns, and, of course, a growing library of podcasts. We cover everything from China’s fraught foreign relations to its ingenious entrepreneurs, from the ongoing repression of Uyghurs and other Muslim peoples in China’s Xinjiang region to Beijing’s ambitious plans to shift the Chinese economy onto a post-carbon footing. It’s a feast of business, political, and cultural news about a nation that is reshaping the world. We cover China with neither fear nor favor. I’m Kaiser Kuo, coming to you from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The sudden arrival of Generative AI, large language models like ChatGPT or Google’s Bard, as well as the proliferation of image, video, and audio AI, certainly feels, at least from my sit, like a technological step change just from a few months ago, really. As we’ve talked about on previous shows, Chinese AI researchers were astonished at what they saw once OpenAI took the wraps off of ChatGPT a few months ago. And when some Chinese companies hurriedly released their own LLMs, reviewers, for the most part, agreed that they were not quite ready for primetime. All this really lit a fire to China’s AI scientists and researchers, whether in tech companies or in research institutes. The fact that the draft of the initial regulations governing Generative AI, something that we talked about on the show a few months ago, had their most onerous and potentially cumbersome requirements actually stripped out of them before the actual regulations were introduced. It shows that Beijing recognizes the importance of this technology and wants, at the very least, to avoid hobbling its domestic companies before they even get out of the starting gate. But will China’s heavy-handed internet censorship hamper its development? And what about U.S. efforts to keep the cutting-edge GPUs, the graphics processing units, or the NPUs, the neural processing units, out of Chinese hands? With me, to talk about the state of play in Chinese Generative AI, is Paul Triolo, senior VP for China and technology policy lead at Dentons Global Advisors, ASG formerly, and probably better, still known as Albright Stonebridge Group. He spent a full quarter-century as a research analyst for the U.S. government at a certain three-letter agency, and he contributes frequently to The China Project, where he writes on all sorts of technology issues pertaining to China, for which we are very grateful. Paul joins us from Washington, D. C. Paul, welcome back to Sinica. Paul Triolo: Thank you, Kaiser. I’m happy to be back. Kaiser: Yeah. Well, the last time I saw you was actually just a few weeks ago in DC, and you were leaving the very next morning for China. So, tell us, just in a nutshell, how was that trip? Paul: It was a great trip, Kaiser. It was largely client-focused, but I managed to find time to discuss this issue of Generative AI with some of the leading Chinese companies that are developing their own large language models and have been doing a lot in the AI space. Kaiser: Yeah. So that’s exactly why I wanted to talk to you because you’re fresh from there. You’ve had a lot of conversations with people across the AI community in China. So how did that community react to the unveiling of ChatGPT by OpenAI? Paul: Yeah, it’s a good question, and it sort of hit two different pieces of the system, right? So, it hit the sort of enterprises in China that are developing these types of capabilities. So, it wasn’t a surprise because the existence of transformers and large language models had been well known in China, which is very plugged in. Chinese companies are very plugged in, and Chinese researchers, to the global sort of AI community. So, not unknown. I think they were surprised that a company like OpenAI decided to release this to the public as an experiment. There was some surprise that they were able to do that. That probably couldn’t happen in China in the same way. And then the regulators, I think, in China too were also sort of forced to respond to this because I think up until that point, regulators were certainly aware of these developments, but they hadn’t really thought necessarily or had really galvanized themselves to sort of figure out how to regulate things like Generative AI. And because of the content, I think it’s important to note that it’s because of the human interaction and the sort of text, not just text, but the sort of text and image and multimodal kinds of Generative AI models, this becomes pretty quickly an issue that regulators are interested in trying to figure out how to get ahead of. And I think that the release of ChatGPT certainly got the attention of both the AI community in China in that sort of alarmist way; like we better catch up because OpenAI is prepped ahead now in the development of these models. And also the regulators were thinking, “Okay, well, if this is going to be out there, we better figure out what to do about it,” in particular, because it’s so focused on natural language processing in particular, and sort of human interaction are the part that is of concern to regulators. Kaiser: No, that makes a ton of sense. So, can you talk broadly about what was on the minds of the technologists you spoke with? I mean, are they smarting over the October 7th announcement? Are they really, really worried? We’ll talk a little bit more about the GPU issue, but are they obsessed with Generative AI, or what’s top of mind for them? Paul: Well, I mean, I think it’s important to just step back quickly and note that since 2017, 2018, when China came out with the National AI Development Plan, for example, AI has not been a sort of a new thing for Chinese technology companies. I mean, going back a decade, Chinese companies have been tracking the cutting-edge developments around the world. And I think in China; the emphasis has been much more on the sort of business and practical implications of AI, right? And so when I did a paper with Kai-Fu Lee, for example, in 2017, that previewed his book, AI Superpowers, we focused on different types of AI like perception AI, internet AI, recommendation algorithms, and logistics, and then sort of autonomous AI — these four sectors. We didn’t, at that time, of course, include things like Generative AI. So I think that AI companies in China have been very focused and foresighted in continuing to develop very practical applications for AI over the past five years. Generative AI sort of injects this new wrinkle into the game because it has implications in terms of increased productivity and sort of all these areas that people have held out hope for, for faster processing of texts on languages and assisting in things like code generation, which is a huge potential application that’s already being used for Generative AI. So, Generative AI sort of changes the game a little bit because it introduces new business models and new areas where AI can be applied. And so, Chinese companies are, again, very plugged into sort of the directionality of the AI development process. And so they, of course, were already looking very hard at things like transformers and the large language models built on those transformers. And so I think they were, again, not surprised, but their focus has been a little different than that of companies in the U.S., like OpenAI in particular, and then all the other many companies that are now focused on generating large language models and applying them in various industry verticals. They’re probably more than any other country, and more than any other AI community are really plugged into what’s going on and tracking developments and trying to take advantage of the sort of state of the art. Kaiser: I don’t think there’s any doubt that in China right now, the flavor of the month is Generative AI, right? There are, of course, as you say, all these other approaches, some of which China has made real headway in. And some of these are continuing to yield major breakthroughs. I think it’s important that we at least talk a little bit about those. Talk about what some of these other areas are. Is there concern that these things might get crowded out due to the interest in LLMs and other Generative AI? I mean, we were talking the other day about things like AlphaFold that Google DeepMind has done. I mean, these are deep reinforcement learning-based AI platforms. Can you talk a little bit about that and the promise that that holds out? Paul: Yeah, I mean, and of course, one of the big factors that drove that National AI Development strategy, for example, released in 2017, was this concern over Go and AlphaGo, and the perception that Western companies like Google DeepMind were leading in these areas and had developed these amazing capabilities using, again, deep reinforcement learning. It seems this is sort of the process that led to something like AlphaFold, which is this very specialized AI capability designed to predict the shape of proteins that has very, very specific and very useful end-use. And so, I think Chinese companies have also been looking at those kinds of applications across things like healthcare, obviously, and drug discovery and those kinds of areas. So, I think that kind of interest is still there. Generative AI, though, has obviously now, as you know, gobbled up a lot of sort of attention and investment in part because it is a broader general-purpose capability. And that’s, of course, what generates a lot of concern is that it is designed to sort of eventually lead to some sort of artificial general intelligence. And this seems closer to that than something like AlphaGo or AlphaFold, which are very narrow applications to gaming, for example, and to things like protein predictions. So, Generative AI sort of generates a lot of fear in some sense about things like, “Hey, we’re going to get eventually to something that’s smarter than humans.” And that’s generated that huge debate in the U.S. about whether there’s a sort of existential threat from AI. Kaiser: In the US, that certainly has been, but what about China? Paul: Yeah, I think, in China, that debate hasn’t been as sort of public. One of the issues is that I think in China, the tech companies have sort of led the development of this. There isn’t this huge independent AI safety community of the type that has developed in the U.S. and in Europe around looking at regulation and worried about all these downsides of AI like bias and disinformation and these other areas. I think in China; the tendency has been to see technology in general and AI as beneficial. And so, to emphasize more the beneficial aspects, the potential gains from deploying AI applications. Where in the West, we have this very big and large and growing community that’s focused on safety and ensuring that AI is deployed and fair in equitable ways. And so, in China, there’s not this rush to think about the existential threats. The companies are very focused, for example, on earning revenue using these AI applications, whether it’s with logistics or other things we’ve talked about. And then Generative AI falls into that category of, “Hey, here’s a new tool, and we can use this to help develop specific applications that will be useful to companies.” And so they haven’t leaped to the sort of existential risks as we saw in the last few months in the U.S. with these various documents coming out, and people signing off letters, various letters that called for concern about this potential threat, existential threat from AI. Kaiser: So, so far, no Chinese Eliezer Yudkowsky has emerged? Paul: No, that’s a good question. There was one professor, I think from Tsinghua, who signed onto one of the letters. But no, not the debate you have in the West where the fathers of AI, for example, Yann LeCun, Jeff Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio, have been part of this huge debate over the last particularly six months about the downsides on both sides of the topic. And in China, again, the Chinese companies and the Chinese AI community have been sort of more focused on basic research and on application. Kaiser: Well, as I’ve said many times, China is in its Star Trek phase, and we are in our black mirror phase already. So yeah, that’s how it goes. So as you know, the regulations on Generative AI were officially promulgated just, I guess, about a month or so ago after a comment period on the initial draft regs. I talked about this, as I said, briefly on the show with Jeremy Daum after they came out. But that show was about something else entirely, and so we just sort of flicked at it. But let me just summarize quickly what Jeremy said because he studied this stuff very, very carefully. First, he said, overall, they are much less stringent than what was laid out in the draft. And they appear to have backed down on certain requirements with the aim, specifically, of allowing the new industry to really develop and flourish. Service providers no longer need to guarantee the truth, so to speak, of either the generated content or even of the underlying data, which was supposed to be, that the training data was supposed to actually be sort of combed over for truth. That was obviously a major hurdle and was basically impossible. I imagine the development community is pretty happy about that change. They also added to this point about concern over safety; I’m glad to see this is coming from the CAC itself, categories of discrimination. There’s language in there about bias, but they’ve added more categories of people they’re worried may be discriminated against, including people with disabilities. And perhaps most importantly, I think maybe they made these new regulations apply only to the public-facing platforms, right? The public-facing Generative AI. So, it doesn’t apply to systems that are purpose-built just for an enterprise or within, even like an industry vertical. Paul: Right. And that’s critical. Yeah. Kaiser: Yeah, absolutely critical. So, with all that as background, when you spoke with AI researchers in China during your trip, did you get a sense of whether they felt like their feedback had helped to bring about this change? Or did they talk about the AI regs and whether they still need to be tweaked? Paul: Yeah, I talked with a lot of people about this. I think it’s important to note that when they work that out, there’s still interim regulations. Part of the game here is that the content regulator here, which is really putting out these regulations, the Cyberspace Administration in China, is very, very focused on the content part of it. And they’re still trying to figure out what to do about all this, right? So the Chinese approach is interesting, and we can talk about the comparison to what the EU and the U.S. are doing because it’s quite different. The regulators in China tend to want to get out in front of this quickly. And so that’s what they’ve done. It’s why they issued these draft regulations in April and quickly turned them around into these interim regs. And yes, the industry had a huge input on this. I talked to a lot of people, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, all the key players, all the key sort of research institutes, the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, all the major big players in sort of LLMs in General AI in China, absolutely weighed in on those draft drags. And now, once they came out, they were really calling them something like a light touch regulation because of those things you mentioned that they roll back a lot of the provisions. For example, another one that was important was they had talked about needing to turn around and redo the model if there was a problem detected with the content that was sort of politically incorrect. They dropped a two-month or three-month turnaround on that because that was considered by the industry to be sort of wildly unreasonable, right? Because it takes time to train these models and to do things like reinforcement learning through human feedback, which is an effort to put guardrails on this. But I think it’s important to notice that, as you said, the thrust of those regulations was really for this public-facing sort of applications of these models. And that’s not where the Chinese companies are focused. They’re very much focused on these industry verticals, which I think… And we can talk about each of the major players and where they are in that. Therefore, they’re less concerned, I would say, about the regulation than some of these other issues which we need to talk about, like U.S. export controls on GPUs, which is a huge issue for the industry in general. But I think, in general, people were happy with the process of feedback and the fact that CAC listened to industry concerns. But again, these are interim regulations. There probably is more to come. And then the last thing I’ll mention on that critically is yesterday, the TC260, which is the standard body, released some really interesting standards drafts related to things like watermarking, to actually watermark content to make sure that it’s clear what has been AI-generated. And it’s a really thoughtful document; if you read through it, it talks about two kinds of watermarks related to generative AI content. One is explicit, a sort of human visible thing, an audible message that would identify content as generated by an AI, large language model, for example, or image generator, and implicit, which would be a sort of watermark that humans can’t see, but computers and machines can extract and sort of determine the origin. In that very practical area, which, again, is also under lots of discussion in other key areas in the U.S. and EU, for example — how do you identify content that is AI generated? China is already sort of arguably well ahead in terms of at least attempting to put out these kinds of standards around this. And I think that might be, for example, an area of collaboration with the EU and the U.S. around some kind of a standard around how you do that. Because If you don’t have an international standard on that, for example, it’s going to be a mess, right? Because- Kaiser: Yeah. It’s encouraging that there’s some convergence on this issue, at least yet. Paul: Yeah. Absolutely. I think that standard area is something hopefully where there could be more international convergence because it’s so important going forward. And so the generative AI interim regs talked about that. And then pretty quickly, and we’re only about a month later, TC260 has come out with these standards. So I think it shows that there is a huge commitment in the system to pursuing and flushing out these kinds of standards and regulations. Kaiser: So while we’re on the subject of the state, aside from wanting to or being willing to clear some of the regulatory obstacles or at least refrain from placing too many obstacles in their path, what else is the state doing to advance these company’s abilities to develop Generative AI and to conduct that kind of research in China? Are they getting any kind of proactive state support? Paul: Yeah. I think that what you’re seeing the state do is signal, at many levels, that this is a priority industry, right? And so Xi Jinping is, well, he makes comments on the importance of things like ai. And so over the last year in particular, and really arguably almost since the 2017 issuance of this national strategy, it’s clear that the government is very supportive of this industry and supports things like industry associations that are focused on ai. Different municipalities like Shanghai and others have all put out favorable guidance and regulations around elements of the AI technology stack. And so, I think there’s a general signal from the center that this is something, an area where Chinese companies should lead, right? And again, there’s this consideration that there are some low lower barriers to entry here except for the hardware part of the stack, which we need to talk about. But I think that generally, the regulations, and also there’s a mod to this in the generative AI regulations, which is they’re trying to clearly balance innovation and regulation here. And this is an area where, because there are so many capable Chinese companies in this space, there’s a real desire, specifically on Generative AI, to channel things into less sensitive areas like enterprise applications, manage the content piece through these regulations, and then provide things like compute capabilities. And so, for example, if you want, if you talk… I don’t know if you had a show on the East Data West Compute Project, which is a huge national effort to establish a series of data centers with advanced computing capabilities and make that available, for example, to companies to develop AI applications. Kaiser: Yeah, Kendra Schaefer flicked that, yeah. Paul: They’re those kinds of very supportive projects which are designed to sort of help fuel the industry. So, I think the government around the industry is trying to build a sort of supportive framework and regulatory framework and encourage companies to use these applications and Chinese companies to be leaders in this space. Kaiser: And investors are usually very sensitive to these signals. And they’re aware of when the government has opened up a new [inaudible 0:21:35], a new kind of wind tunnel. And so they set their sails by those. And is that happening in this case? Is there a lot of investor money going into Generative AI startups? Paul: It’s a good question. I think it’s also a tricky period, of course, generally in the Chinese economy in terms of investments and sort of economic growth. I think, ironically, the sort of frenzy in AI and generated AI is happening at a time of sort of economic downturn. So, I think right now it’s tricky because big companies like Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei have already had the resources to invest in these kinds of capabilities. And again, they’re very expensive to invest in. This depends on what you’re doing. But if you’re trying to develop your own large language model, you need a lot of computing, you need data, you need a lot of cloud interface, and you need a lot of money to spend to actually train a model. I mean, I think the estimate was $300 million to train ChatGPT 4; I believe that is the figure. And so, we’re talking big bucks to actually play in the game of large language models. So, there’s already sort of a limitation in terms of the type of company that can do this. I think in China; there will be investments in companies with sort of niche pieces of the technology stack related to Generative Ai. But I don’t think that there’s been this huge, massive influx into the space yet. I think in the U.S., you do see a lot more interest, for example, in second-tier companies that are beyond the sort of big players. But they’re all very narrowly focused on certain areas like image generation, or in the case of a company like Cohere AI, for example, they’re very narrowly focused on business applications and not large line models for general purposes. It’s a good question on the startups. I just haven’t seen what I think is a huge flood, again, because some of these things are going to take big, big investments over long periods of time to play in space. Kaiser: Real barriers to entry. Yeah, for sure. I mean, finally, I think we should get to U.S. policy and the export bans on advanced GPUs and other chips that are used in these large neuro networks. I guess I want to start with maybe you could sort of layout where we are right now in terms of regulation. I mean, I know that you’ve been keeping up on the other piece, which is an investment, outbound investment bans into certain key areas, including into Generative AI, I believe. So give us a press of the state of things right now in terms of U.S. policy. Paul: Sure. I think U.S. policy, with respect to Generative AI, is coming down in sort of two big areas. So, the first is an attempt to target the sort of advanced hardware, which is, at the base of the technology stack, generating things like large language models. So that’s the semiconductor base. Usually, on top of that, you’re running models, in development environments, like PyTorch and TensorFlow. And then, on top of that, you’re running specific training algorithms to train the large language models, and then finally, you have some end-use. At the base of that are things like advanced GPUs, which turn out to be ideal for training large language models, sort of parallel processing. And so the U.S., last October, began this effort to sort of control the ability of Chinese companies to have access to those parts of the hardware stack, where U.S. companies frankly dominate, right? And where there are not a lot of other alternatives. The line from the administration is that this is narrowly focused on national security. So, advances in AI are now considered very much in the national security domain. Now, it’s tricky because in this arena, unlike, for example, export controls on weapons of mass destruction, where it’s clear what the threat is, everybody understands that we want to control technologies that enable the development of nuclear weapons, AI is a little more nebulous here. What exactly is the sort of killer app, for example, that is going to change the military balance, whether it’s between U.S. and China or China and a Taiwan contingency, it’s really hard to define that. And so, in a sense, what the U.S. is trying to do is solve for the future potential of China, for example, or Russia or other countries to develop an advanced AI capability that somehow proves to be a game changer. So, it’s a little bit novel to use in that sense of export controls. Now, GPUs and other advanced computing capabilities, for example, can be used in high-performance computing to accelerate, for example, their model development for weapon systems. And so, that’s a tangible use, but the vast majority of Generative AI is not used for that. So, Generative AI is sort of a different ball game. Generative AI, for the most part, the applications are civilian in nature, right? Drug discovery, better understanding of mapping data or environmental data. I mean, all sorts of applications that are not necessarily, clearly jump out at you as military. So, it’s tricky in the sense that the U.S. is pursuing these controls on the hardware with the long-term goal of preventing the emergence of AI in China as some sort of military force. And then the other piece of it is an investment in those sectors, not just ai, but other things like semiconductors, of course, and quantum. And just today, before I got on this call, the U.S. government released this new draft executive order or executive order and a proposed rule that would control the investments by U.S. persons and U.S. companies, for example, venture capital and private equity into companies in China that are in these critical technology areas. AI, interestingly, is a little more undeveloped in terms of how those controls are going to work than semiconductors because there are existing export controls that the outbound investment will seek to align with, right? But AI is software. So, U.S. officials talk about not trying to control all software but very specific applications of AI, right? Like surveillance, facial recognition, and those kinds of areas where there’s a clear link to some activity that the U.S. considers of national security import. But again, they’re seeking feedback over the next three to six months around this rule to try to really keep it narrow and focused on military and sort of applications like surveillance that are considered to be important. So, we’re sort of in a new area where AI is now part of the learning process of how the U.S. and other Western allies will control China’s access to this critical technology and try to do it in a narrow and targeted way. But that’s going to be difficult to keep narrow and targeted because of these other broader applications of ai that are mostly available. Kaiser: That the sort of hardware foundations of this, as you say, is the same whether we’re talking about deep reinforcement learning or we’re talking about Generative Ai. I mean, it’s exactly the same gigantically networked bundles of GPUs, right? I mean, we’re talking trillions of connections at this point, right? Paul: Right. We’re talking about 10,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, for example, that were used to train ChatGPT 4. And these are very specialized systems that require, again, lots of hardware knowledge and then are very expensive to run. But those GPUs tend to be particularly suited to large language models. The thing that I’m still trying to get my head around that is the U.S. government’s concern, specifically about generative AI. Which, again, on the surface of it, there’s no clear, obvious sort of military end-use. I mean, you can envision some, certainly, in different applications, but it’s still sort of an R&D phase, if you will. And it’s still very much developmental and is used primarily in China. (29:54): If you look at all the different companies, they’re very focused on… Think of coal mining, right? Huawei’s Pangu model is being used to help optimize coal mining, right? A very mundane but important industry, but not a military application. Kaiser: Yeah. It’s tough. I mean, I think the assumption is that it democratizes access to… Anyone can code, right? Anyone who knows how to write a query and knows how to write prompts just unleashes a lot of power into a lot of hands. I suppose that’s a concern. Paul: Yeah. It can certainly accelerate the development of software code, right? Absolutely. Absolutely. But again, traditionally, the export control system and even the inbound investment system were really focused on this narrow set of technologies with a much clearer link to sort of the military end-use, right? Particularly for weapons of mass destruction. I mean, the materials were very specific to the nuclear industry, for example, or the sensors were specific to missile technology. Now we’re sort of several steps back in the food chain here, looking at semiconductors which are themselves, not the problem, but what they could be used for, depending on the application and the software, etc. There are a lot more links in the chain to get to the actual military end-use. And that presents a challenge for other countries to sort of align with the U.S. on the idea that denying the most advanced GPUs, for example, to China, is a way to sort of stave off a big national security problem. And a lot of countries are realigned on. Kaiser: It seems the U.S. has already made up its mind, though. Anyway, it’s obviously something that is a gigantic concern to people in the Chinese AI research community. What are they doing by way of workarounds? Maybe we can first talk about the move that many of them have made now. I mean, I’m thinking specifically about Alibaba, Alibaba Cloud, and its take on Meta’s Llama system, basically. It’s called Tongyi Qianwen (通义千问), an open-source large language model. Is that part of the workaround strategies that they’re going to be doing? Paul: It’s a great question. I think there are lots of different pieces to the workaround strategy. One is to, for example, Bytedance, and others are trying to acquire large numbers of GPUs before the Commerce Department might change the requirements around the performance thresholds for the, for example, NVIDIA GPUs. So, Chinese companies can still buy A800 and H800s, which were the modified versions that NVIDIA put out after the October 7th controls. And so, Bytedance has put in a huge order for these things, right? So, one strategy is to let’s stock up as much as we can on the existing hardware. And then the second one will probably be acquiring these restricted semiconductors through lots of different channels, right? Getting around export controls using front companies, etc. That is already probably going on because these are… In some cases, you can go on online and buy these, right? The bigger systems that incorporate dozens or hundreds of processors are going to be much harder to acquire. But smaller numbers can be acquired. And then the other approach is to use alternative indigenously developed capabilities. For example, Huawei is using its Ascend processors that it developed on its own. Those were originally manufactured at TSMC before Huawei was restricted from using TSMC. They’re probably going to be using domestic layers like SMIC to continue to manufacture those. But they advertise there, for example, their AI stack or Generative AI as including being trained on the Ascend processor. And they have enough of those, of the existing generation, to do a pretty good job of training their large language models. And this is happening in the West too. Companies have their own processor; they’re optimized for their own hardware to train models, etc. Google’s doing this, of course, with products like TensorFlow. And Baidu has the same thing. Baidu has Kunlun, which is its processor. That’s one way around that bundling. Maybe larger numbers are not as efficient as having access to the latest stuff, but you can still do a pretty good job training these large language models. And then the third way is, interestingly, as you noted, Baidu and Alibaba are allowing Llama, this Meta open sourced model to be, to be accessed from their cloud services. Kaiser: Oh, I see. Paul: Now, this is interesting because I’m still wondering how the Chinese regulators will view this and whether that will be something that requires a license eventually. Because again, back to the regulation issue, CAC is going to come up with a licensing arrangement around these models so they have some visibility into what these models are doing. Kaiser: So, it’s actually Llama. They’re accessing Llama through their cloud, not actually building a cloud-based… Paul: Yes, this is an open-source model. It’s this model as a service. So, the big players, particularly Baidu and Alibaba, are offering large language models as a service. So, again, with access to the cloud and API, you can access these models and then develop and use your own proprietary data user. These are private clouds or hybrid clouds. You can develop your own private application using your own proprietary data using one of these models. And so, in a sense, that’s a pretty important way of sort of a workaround because those models were developed by Meta using their large computing capabilities. And so you can access those to train them on your own data. It’s an important ability. And right now, I should say the U.S. government is probably thinking about how we control open sourcing of large language models like that. Because that’s sort of a little bit of a loophole, right? Where Chinese companies don’t have to rely only on their own domestically developed models. But the gain now is for large cloud providers to provide access to these models, license access, help companies develop their own sort of enterprise model, and then charge for the service. That’s sort of how you make money off these things. Huawei, for example, has a set of large language models that are optimized for mining, as I mentioned earlier, meteorology, called Pangu weather; railway, monitoring railway traffic; and things like drugs — drug discovery. So, each of the big players in China specializes in developing models that are optimized for particular industry verticals. Kaiser: Yeah. And this is something that you had anticipated. I remember you had written something in Digital China right after the draft regs came out, and you had said that you anticipated that that would be the direction that Chinese companies would take. That they would focus on industry verticals rather than doing these big general-purpose agents like ChatGPT. So give me some examples. I mean, you’ve just mentioned a few that are very interesting — mining, meteorology. What are some of the applications of Generative AI to specific databases? I mean, what would it look like? I mean, like you mentioned, meteorology, how would that play? I mean, what does it do in practice? Paul: Well, in the case of, for example, Huawei’s Pangu weather, they claim that it outperforms sort of standard models in terms of accuracy for weather forecasting, right? So, you’re applying, yeah, it sort of speeds up the ability to do forecasting, predicting the trajectory of typhoons. I wonder if that predicted the trajectory of the recent typhoons that hit China in a big way. These models are now trained and can plow through data much faster. And so, for example, what took ten days, now using these models, they can get the predictability down to four or five hours. So, it’s sort of optimizing the ability to crunch through a lot of data, as with specific models that are optimized for a particular data set. Baidu, for example, is another interesting case where they have the Ernie, sort of big model, which is sort of an analog of ChatGPT. And then they have also what they call the information distribution big model, transportation big model, and energy big model. They’re selling these now as a service. So, if you’re an energy company, you can come in, you might have a particular data center issue that you want to optimize, the use of energy in that data center, and you can use these large language models to crunch the proprietary data that you already have in that sector, and then develop sort of solutions that optimize something like energy use and data center. That’s the way that Chinese companies are thinking about doing that. Kaiser: So, Paul, let me understand. Let me understand, so this means, I mean, I suppose part of it is just the ability to use natural language, just sort of ordinary language to prompt or to query, and to pull kind of useful information out of these unwieldy, unstructured datasets, right? Paul: Yes. Kaiser: Okay. Paul: Right. Let me give you another good example, and this is coming from a large U.S. company, but this is the kind of thing that Chinese companies are doing too. They’re assembling and training a version of ChatGPT, for example, 4, on huge datasets related to weather data and rainfall data and sort of mapping data in a proprietary context. And then researchers, who may not be experts in this area, can go in and query using normal human fairly straightforward queries, and the model will generate, it’s a multimodal model, and it can generate text and images related to that specific query. And normally, these kinds of databases are only accessible to specialist researchers. But here now, you’re sort of opening the aperture in terms of who can access these kinds of datasets in a more sort of natural interrogation using the front end of something like ChatGPT that people are now more familiar with, as you’ve seen. And you’ve seen companies now, there are whole companies that are coming up with, here’s optimized queries. Here are the types of queries you can use, for example, to optimize your output. I use this, actually just recently, I wrote an email, and I wrote it, and I asked ChatGPT, for example, to make it more deferential to the person I was writing the letter to, to make sure that I wasn’t too sort of passive-aggressive. And it did a great job of doing that. Kaiser: Maybe use that on your tweets from now on, Paul. Paul: Yeah, I’ll need to run my tweets through ChatGPT. Bard is actually my new favorite. Bard is very good because it’s up to date, whereas ChatGPT 4, the training data, ended in September 2021 or 2021. Kaiser: Right. And so do Chinese companies, though. Do they lose out? I mean, I see the appeal of using… I mean, for very many reasons, for focusing on discrete industry verticals, but don’t they lose out on something by not going after general-purpose tools? I mean, five years, ten years from now, are Chinese tech companies going to be at a huge disadvantage because they didn’t pursue general-purpose technologies? Paul: It’s a good question, and I think it depends on how this evolves. I mean, in the West, in the sort of outside of China, the thinking is that at some point, these general models, they’ll sort of become your personal assistant, right? So, you’ll have your sort of individual model that’s sort of trained on your own data, understands you, and can be sort of optimized to respond to your needs. And again, the revenue model there is still not clear to me. I mean, I’m paying $20 a month for ChatGPT, and I use it all the time. Kaiser: Yeah, me too. Paul: But I think in the West, the general models will become important for sort of individual use and then also as a window into some of these more specialized areas, right? As people get used to interacting with these chat models, then if you need something that’s more detailed, you can call … they’ll be linked to other more narrow and detailed types of applications, like AlphaFold even. I mean, AlphaFold could be something that you’re doing research, and then all of a sudden, you might want to take a look at some scientific problem, and then you might use your sort of ChatGPT and your general interface to interact with that. So yes, in China, I think eventually but once the regulations are clear, right? I mean, again, I think that Chinese companies are being careful here not to get out in front of the regulators because this is such a potentially explosive political alignment problem for those companies. So I think once CAC figures out how to license these things, and then as companies get more adept at this reinforcement learning through human feedback, which is how they put guardrails on this, U.S. companies are doing this too. I’m sure that Chinese companies like Baidu, in particular, that have the Ernie bot, which is really probably the most capable challenger of something like ChatGPT that has done very well in benchmarks, by the way, in comparison to ChatGPT, that will become something that eventually we’ll probably see wider use because there is a demand for that, right? When ChatGPT went up, a lot of people got U.S. phone numbers and VPNs and were accessing ChatGPT from China, even though OpenAI tried to restrict that geographic geofence. So, there’s a tremendous amount of interest in China in these kinds of capabilities, but because of the political alignment problem, the companies are trying to get down the sort of non-sensitive applications and models. And then, eventually, I think that there’ll be a more general development of general models that are more usable by the public once the regulatory system is a little bit more firm. So, they don’t want to run afoul of things before that happens. And they’ll work closely with the regulators to try to make sure that they don’t get ahead of the game. Kaiser: So, for the benefit of my listeners here, I mean, I know that during the course of this conversation, we’ve name-checked a lot of companies and talked about what they’re doing, about their general sort of strategy and some of the novel things that they’ve been pursuing. Maybe we can put it all in one place and do it a little more systematically and just kind of go through company by company. Let’s go. I mean, here are the companies. Let’s do Alibaba, obviously, Tencent, Baidu, Huawei, and Bytedance; I think we’ve named it. Maybe that’s a good enough start. Why don’t we start with Alibaba? We’ve already talked a little bit about how they’re making Llama, Meta’s Llama, available through the Alibaba Cloud. What else are they doing? I mean, they bring a lot of assets to this obviously. They have all that payment data; they have all that purchase data. So, what are they doing with that? Paul: Yeah. I think it’s important in general to note that each of the companies that have aspirations in this space brings advantages. So Alibaba, as you rightly point out, brings, for example, lots of logistics data. The verticals that they’ll be focused on will likely include things like logistics, also, of course, payments and payment systems. And then other areas like they’ve been working, for example, already with some industry verticals as part of their Ali Cloud offering. And they also have Ali Cloud, right? They have a sort of advantage in terms of being a cloud services provider because that’s important in a way that some of the other players, like Bytedance, is not really a cloud services provider. They have a very specialized thing. In general and globally, companies that are developing models are partnering, of course, with cloud service providers. That’s why Microsoft and OpenAI, for example, are partnered; and Google and Inflection or Anthropic, I’m sorry, Anthropic. So, companies are sort of playing to their strengths. Alibaba, again, also has things like its own DAMO Academy. And they’re doing a lot with developing a sort of broader hardware and software stack for AI development. And so Generative AI sort of fits into that model. Baidu, as I noted, has its advantages. It has 20 years of search data in Chinese, right? And so, they’re very much focused on these… And that’s why Ernie Bot probably is so good because he’s trained in 98% Chinese language. And they claim that it has the unique ability to tease out insights in terms of the Chinese language. Kaiser: That’s always Baidu’s line. Yeah. Paul: Huawei is a little bit different in the sense that they’re so focused on the enterprise. They say things like we don’t write poems, right? So, this little classic comment from Huawei. So they’re very much focused already on these industry verticals. And that’s in part, of course, because they’ve been, since their controls on things like telecommunications, inputs, and semiconductors, they’ve been seeking out new markets. And so they’ve been looking at these industry verticals like automating port facilities and mining operations. And so, they’re very much focused on that area. But their cloud services also, again, are very robust. And so they’re offering this all through their cloud services. And they’re also trying to develop a sort of full stack, development stack. So the hardware, the development environment. MindSpore is, for example, Huawei’s equivalent to PyTorch and TensorFlow, which are these really critical development environments. And MindSpore is also compatible with PyTorch. So, they’re trying to figure out how to get developers, for example, in that space to develop applications using tools that they’re familiar with. And then Baidu has PaddlePaddle, for example, which is its sort of equivalent development environment. The game sort of has this full stack of development tools from hardware to the development environment to large lineage models through this model as a service that we talked about earlier. And so each of the companies is offering these kinds of services and then optimizing those models for those areas where it has some advantage in the data space. And so, again, Baidu has this transportation model and has this big energy model, along with the Ernie Bot. And then Huawei has these very specific areas, meteorology, mining, railway, and drugs. They’ve just expanded into government finance and manufacturing. And they’re offering specialized versions of, for example, Pangu in those sectors. And so that’s the trend you’re going to see. Bytedance, it’s not clear to me. Bytedance has a lot of data, obviously, from social media and from all the interactions, including a lot of videos. And so how they’re going to in the Generative AI trend here, they already have very well developed, of course, algorithms for recommending like-minded content. It’s not clear to me how they’re going to play in this in the same way as those other companies, which are… Kaiser: Filters and things like that. Paul: Yeah. I mean, I’m sure they’ll develop capabilities that further their business model using Generative AI. But these other, Huawei, Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba, these are companies that are trying to figure out how to leverage their underlying datasets and their AI expertise in developing large language models to actually service clients in these industry verticals. Kaiser: What about companies like Meituan? Are you aware of them doing much? And Alibaba competitors like Pingduoduo or JD. Paul: Yeah. A lot of the big companies, Meituan is part of this, have also announced that they’re working on large language models. But the question for China is, and similar to the U.S., is how many individual models are sort of needed? Because you have a fairly large number of… I think in China; it’s now 180 or something. There’s a large number if you look across all of the companies and some of the research institutes, Tsinghua, of course, has its own big large language model. And BAAI also has its WuDao, which is one of the first bigger models. If you look at them, though, they’re all sort of different. They have different training sets, datasets, and different ability to, to be deployed. Part of the game, too, is that you want to… These big large language models they’re expensive to train, and then they’re also expensive to deploy in some cases too. So, there are smaller models, for example, that are being developed that are, again, sort of niche areas that aren’t as expensive to develop. Because this is not a game for people without some resources, both in terms of computing and sort of data center power, but also just for people who understand talent. So, there’s also sort of a lot of competition to recruit people who understand these models and how to deploy them in a sort of enterprise context, for example. Kaiser: Yeah. Let’s move on and talk about… We’ve talked a lot about hardware and software, but let’s talk about talent, as you say. What’s your sense of how China’s faring in that regard? Because I thought a few years ago, it’s fair to say the consensus would’ve been that China was awash in kind of mid-level coders. But the really innovative AI scientists were pretty few and far between. But that seems to be changing too, at least to look at the names and the major peer-reviewed papers that are being published. Paul: Yeah. That’s a tricky, tricky topic, sort of; how does China stack up on the talent side? You can look at things like the top 1% of cited papers, and that’s certainly an area where if you look at that over the last five years, Chinese researchers, working for companies and for key state-owned labs, for example, have really have moved up in the specific areas, particularly for things like image recognition. One of the major papers that all subsequent research on sort of image recognition references is a paper that’s in the top 1%, where all the researchers are from China, from different organizations. From that perspective, China has come from, say, ten years ago, to being really critical Chinese researchers in these key areas, but particularly for these niches like recognition and now natural language processing. And the quality of the education system, of course, in China is hugely improved. And so when I talk to people in China, for example, who are recruiting software engineers to work on important AI projects, and at commercial companies, they’re blown away, for example, by the quality of the talent they’re seeing at second and third-tier universities in China. All the- Kaiser: Second and third tier. Paul: Yeah. So like everybody knows about Tsinghua and Beida. But we’re talking about Huazhong University, maybe in Wuhan, and universities like Zhongshan University In Guangzhou. Second, you know China’s education is very tiring, right? And everybody else that get into the five schools, but, but they’re recruiting at these second or third tier universities and are finding that the software talent is every bit as good as a top university. So, I think that speaks to the idea that over time, for example, China is going to have a big advantage in terms of personnel and sort of the talent pool that’s going to be available to help drive forward innovation in this sector, including in Generative AI. In the U.S., of course, universities remain extremely desirable for foreign students to come and study at. And companies like Google, of course, and DeepMind, AWS, and Microsoft are also hiring large amounts of really capable people. I think that the challenge will be as the U.S.-China relations get tenser and that we avoid some sort of bifurcation in the AI space. Because, as you know, there’s been so much collaboration in AI. And a lot of the leading Chinese AI scientists, for example, and company presidents came out of things like Microsoft Research Asia, where they were trained, or they went to university in the U.S., and then they went back to China. So, there’s been a tremendous amount of cross-fertilization between the sectors and the education systems on AI. This has benefited everybody. And so it’s one of the things we want to try to, I think, avoid decoupling, for example, in that sector. Kaiser: That’s right. And that’s actually what I wanted to ask you about to wrap this up. We are seeing this sort of movement toward a bifurcation, as unfortunate it is as it is. Maybe, Paul, you could spell out what some of the other costs of that are, not just to this wonderful period of collaboration and cross-pollination. But what dangers are posed by the kind of decoupled world of parallel AI platforms? What are we losing as we move toward that? Paul: It’s a great question. Well, I think it fundamentally, I think that the sort of free freer flow of personnel and back and forth between Chinese companies, U.S. companies, researchers, has really been of such huge benefit to the whole sector that any sort of separation there is going to be tough, for example, for U.S. companies if they can’t recruit and retain leading software engineers from China, right? And so, yeah, U.S. immigration law, for example, is so in need of reform, H1B, all, all these areas that have been sort of neglected. And then, of course, we have this sort of a more hostile environment in the U.S. caused by things like the China Initiative. And so over time, if the U.S. becomes a more hostile environment for AI researchers, and we saw during the pandemic, for example, people unwilling to travel to the U.S., even after the pandemic, some of the conferences that were held in the U.S., leading AI conferences, much less attendance from China. And if you remember this, four years ago, one of the leading conferences, NeurIPS, it was held during the Chinese New Year, and they moved it because the attendance of Chinese researchers was considered so important. It’s hard to imagine that happening now, unfortunately, right? Because now, there’s a reluctance on both sides, I think, to sort of pursue some of the collaboration that’s happened in the past. That’s one thing. And then the other thing is all this is happening within a huge debate about how to regulate AI in the EU, in the U.S., and of course, in China, as we’ve talked about. And so there is a general sense that there needs to be some, ideally some, international global cooperation on this around things like standards for watermarking content, right? I mean, if we get into a world where we have a very different regulatory environment in China versus the rest of the world, and Chinese companies are leading the development in some of these areas, it’s going to be really suboptimal in terms of attempting to regulate AI and the spread of AI more globally into the global south and other places, other applications, right? So, I think there’s a huge need to include Chinese companies and Chinese regulatory authorities in the global debate about how to regulate this industry. Because other than the U.S. and Canada’s big players, and you have some other small players, China’s, by far, the biggest player in this space globally. Kaiser: Absolutely. Paul: If you’re going to leave out half the world on AI, that’s bad. From a U.S. national security perspective, for example, you don’t want to lose insight into what’s happening in China. And so China is such a black box on AI. That would be really bad. And then the surprises that people are worried about would become more likely because the communities wouldn’t be exchanging things. Right now, it’s hard to see a surprise in AI that, for example, is a huge military benefit because everybody is sort of… There’s a lot of interaction, and people know where things are developed, and nobody’s going off in secret and isolated from the broader community and trying to develop some AI capability that’s nefarious. Right now, it’s sort of out in the open. People are publishing. But as people stop publishing because of these sensitivities, for example, and people stop making things available, open source for example, then you’re going to get into a very scary world where nobody knows what the other side is doing, and then that can lead to bad outcomes. Kaiser: It’s really an argument against walling off from a national security perspective. And we do need to take the national security concerns very seriously. Thank you so much, Paul. I mean, it’s great that you could join me again and take time out of what was a very, very busy day for you. Let’s move on to recommendations. First, a quick couple of reminders. First, don’t forget that our next China conference is in New York on November 2nd. It’s an amazing event space. It’s going to be a delight. You can get tickets now. We’ve got amazing speakers lined up, just deep and very thin panels. Yasheng Huang is going to be keynoting; it’s going to be amazing. There are going to be some deep-dive breakout sessions on very, very important topics, including a couple of technology-related topics. We’re even going to do a game show, which is going to be just splendid. I’m going to be hosting that at the end of the day. I am also going to be taping a cynical live along with Jeremy on the evening of November 1st in New York. So, if you get your VIP tickets for that, you can attend that as well. Sign up for that and make sure to do that. That’ll be fun. I’ll look forward to seeing a lot of you in New York. And if you can’t come to our conference but you still want to support the work that we do, as always, please take a moment and become an access member of The China Project. You get our daily Dispatch, this excellent newsletter. You get early access to Sinica, most weeks, not… Sorry, I’ve been lapsing a little bit recently because I’ve been on holiday and much more. It’s all for the cost of what? Like three or four cups of coffee a month. All right, onto recommendations. Paul, what do you have for us, man? Paul: Okay, well, I got a couple of things. One is sort of along the lines we’ve been talking about. I think The Alignment Problem, which is by Brian Christian, talks about machine learning and human values and talks about the sort of broader issue of how to align the development of AI with human development. I think it’s a very thoughtful treatment of the topic. And really is- Kaiser: It’s a book or? Paul:It’s pretty amazing. I also recommend a trilogy of books actually by Larry McMurtry, A Lonesome Dove trilogy. Kaiser: I love it. I love it. Paul:I guess actually a trilogy, and a particular, Comanche Moon, which is, I think, the second book, which is an amazing look at the sort of American southwest in the last century or, I guess, in the 19th century, and just gives you an amazing- Kaiser: I absolutely love Lonesome Dove. I haven’t read the others in the trilogy Paul: Yeah, they made a film of it, but I think the books are really rich in terms of … along with Cormac McCarthy, which is the other one I recommend, Blood Meridian, of course, which is sort of a similar line here. Kaiser: My favorite novel. Paul: Another novel; it’s amazing. Kaiser: My favorite novel of all time. Yeah. Paul: I think I’ve just been, lately, interested in that period of U.S. history, which I think is very important. Kaiser: Oh, that’s amazing. Yeah. There are some good Westerns that have shown up on streaming services recently. I saw one called Hostiles, which is pretty good. Paul: Yeah, I think the Western genre has sort of returned to some level of interest, but I think there’s been new research too that’s gone on about a period and how the U.S. dealt with things like large, the large Indian populations in the West and how they interacted, which I think were really quite interesting. And so, I think that’s an area- Kaiser: Excellent. Paul: So, lots of tech. I could recommend a lot more other tech books, but I won’t do that since we talked so much about AI. Yeah. Kaiser: Well, you want; again, you can recommend some more. Excellent. My recommendation for the week is just the third and final season, actually the whole show, but the third season of the HBO Show, The Righteous Gemstones, just concluded. It stars the inimitable John Goodman as a megachurch minister with three truly awful adult children. So, it’s sort of like a more farcical, over-the-top succession because that’s also the issue sort of who succeeds him at the head of the church. It’s, it’s very, very funny. You might think that maybe bible thumping charlatans are too easy a target for really effective satire, but this is really funny. It’ll keep surprising you. It’s actually quite inventive. Walton Goggins stars in a bunch of episodes in the last two seasons of it. Now, he’s always … anything he touches is just great. So yeah, a show for you. And the other one I would recommend is Hulu; they have the sort of reboot of one of my favorite shows of old Justified. It’s called… It’s something written originally, a character created by Elmore Leonard and taken from some of his short stories Fire in the Hole and this one called City Primeval. So this stars Timothy Olyphant, who’s just amazing. And so, he’s so cool and so… He’s sly and cool and charming. He is just such a winning character in Raylan Givens, the character that he plays. So yeah, check those shows out. The Righteous Gemstones and Justified: City Prime Evil. Paul: Cool. Kaiser: All right, Paul. Great to have you on again, man. Paul: My pleasure, Kaiser. I always enjoy our discussions. I commend the podcast for doing such a good job. I’m telling you it’s worth it. Kaiser: Thanks so much, man.

      "title": "The best all-inclusive Morocco holidays for 2023",
      "text": "A country steeped in history, Morocco is a beguiling mix of Arabian, Berber and European influences. The North African country has been important on the world stage since the early days of Islam. Nowadays, almost half a century since gaining independence from France, it remains a bastion of Arabic culture. Whether you’re wandering the crowded streets of Casablanca, enjoying the beaches of Essaouira or hiking up the towering Atlas Mountains, you’ll be struck by the vibrant colours, fascinating traditions and rich heritage of the country. Its cultural significance, combined with a variety of captivating cities, impressive natural sites and a warm climate, makes Morocco a magnificent place to visit. Several package holiday providers in the UK offer trips, with options including city breaks in Marrakech and beach resorts on the coast. With the option to visit late into October and the start of winter, we’ve rounded up some of the best all-inclusive deals for late autumn. One of the four former capital cities (along with Fez, Meknes and current capital Rabat), Marrakech remains the country’s most popular city for foreign tourists. Located inland near the centre of the country, it is a buzzing city that showcases historic Moroccan culture and traditions and their fusion with modern Arab – and in some cases foreign – influences. The heart of Marrakech is the Medina district, the original fortified part of the city. It is a maze of winding streets that house some of the city’s most important historical sites, from the Koutoubia Mosque and the Kasbah to the ornate Bahia Palace and several large traditional residences. This history meets the present in the Jemaa el-Fna square, where market stalls line the streets, shoppers haggle with traders, locals put on music and theatre shows and diners enjoy local delicacies. Gueliz and Ville Nouvelle are more modern neighbourhoods, with European-style wide streets and Western hotel brands and restaurants. Head to the shopping quarters such as Sidi Ghanem and experience the pulsing nightlife on show in Ville Nouvelle. Other attractions include the Jardin Majorelle, the Yves Saint Laurent Museum, the central souks and the Saadian Tombs. Read more on Morocco travel: British Airways Holidays has the best offer for this magnificent hotel that lies around six miles from the centre of Marrakech. A blend of European and Moorish design imbued with elements of Moroccan style, this hotel is housed in rows of white and red buildings overlooking a large outdoor swimming pool backed by gardens. The hotel has another two pools (one of which is adults-only and another which has a poolside bar), and other facilities include a gym and spaces for trying your hand at football, volleyball, badminton, tennis and archery (there is also a programme of organised activities). For something a little more relaxing, try a spa treatment or visit the sauna and Turkish bath. The rooms at this Iberostar have an modern, minimalist design, with large balconies a particular highlight. The common areas are even more opulent, with complex domed ceilings, vast chandeliers and intricate tile patterns. Prices from £701pp for seven nights’ accommodation, all-inclusive, with return flights from Gatwick, one piece of 23kg checked luggage per passenger and airport transfers. Departing 6 November. Thomas Cook provides packages to Sol Oasis, around 20 minutes’ drive from the northern Gueliz district (the hotel provides a free shuttle service to the centre). Completely renovated in 2021, it now features an array of state-of-the-art facilities, from its spa and gym to its badminton, tennis and volleyball courts. The vast outdoor pool and terrace are the focal point, with seating for dozens of guests. There’s a small bar by the pool, or guests can head to the on-site cafe or restaurant for something more substantial. Ensuite rooms are large and include an outdoor seating area, with views of the hotel’s pristine gardens or pool area. Decor around the rest of the hotel features high, mosaiced ceilings in reception and large columns that adorn the dining areas and outside seating areas. The terraces and gardens are serene, surrounded by green grass, palm trees and atmospheric lights. Prices from £610pp for seven nights’ accommodation, all-inclusive, with return flights from Stansted. Checked baggage can be added starting from £44, while transfers cost an additional £27 per person. Departing 31 October. Some would argue that a stay in a traditional riad – historic Moroccan houses built around courtyard gardens – is the best way to experience Marrakech, and Tui provides excellent value on a trip to Riad La Maison des Oliviers. Situated in the Medina district near the Jemaa el-Fna, it’s the ideal location for exploring the best of the city. Guests at this riad will enjoy a Moroccan holiday that is every bit as traditional as it is luxurious. The hotel design is based on a kasbah, a type of old city fortification, with the complex split into three different riads housed in a series of ochre and red buildings. Each riad has its own private swimming pool (with views of the Atlas Mountains), gardens and terrace area, while each individual floor also has an extra terraced section. Interiors are heavily focused on Moroccan design, with a mix of muted pastel tones and geometric patterns and walls and ceilings decorated with patterned domes, arches and pieces of art and ceramics. For those days spent away from the city, the spa features a sauna, Turkish bath and beauty salon offering spa treatments. You can rent equipment for cycling, mountain biking, table tennis and volleyball; relax by the poolside bar; or go for a meal in the terraced restaurant, which serves a mix of Moroccan delicacies and crowd-pleaser international dishes. Do note that for trips to Morocco leaving on or after 1 November, Tui is offering an extra £100 off when you spend £800 (using the code MOROCCO100); a room upgrade on this package costs £55 (taking the total to £810). From £755pp for four nights’ accommodation, all-inclusive, with return flights from London Luton and airport transfers. Departing 3 November. Agadir is a seaside resort city on the Atlantic coast, roughly three hours southwest of Marrakech. It was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 1960, but has since been rebuilt and has subsequently become one of the best beach resorts in Morocco. Today, the old city walls overlook a network of streets that hide shops, restaurants, souks and Turkish baths, leading out to a picturesque marina area and over seven miles of golden sands. A more laid-back alternative to the better-known Moroccan cities, Agadir has managed to retain its history and culture while becoming a popular destination for tourists. Sites such as the Oufella (the remains of the ancient fortress, built in 1540) and the Medina d’Agadir (a detailed replica of what part of the city looked like before the earthquake) have preserved the past, while a spate of developed modern features, from the Turkish baths at Argan Palace to the Souk El Had and the green spaces of Olhao and the Vallee des Oiseaux, blend modern living with ancient Moroccan culture. EasyJet’s package for Les Jardins d’Agadir is a great-value option for a stay in the city. Situated just five minutes away from the beach, it is also under 10 minutes from the centre and within easy reach of attractions including the Royal Palace and Souk El Had. Built in traditional style with ornamental Moroccan features, Les Jardins is a charming hotel of white buildings, green roofs, landscaped gardens and tall palm trees. Restaurants, bars and common areas are far from flashy; instead, they’re pared-back and informal with touches of Moroccan and Arabian design, from tiled mosaics to large arches. Rooms follow a similar concept; large in size with simple, unassuming interiors. Activities such as tennis, football or a visit to the spa and sauna will keep you busy in between a dip in either of the two swimming pools. When it comes to meal times, opt for the poolside snack bar for a quick bite, or take your time over a sit-down meal in either the international buffet restaurant or the a la carte restaurant serving Moroccan delicacies. Any of the three bars offer post-dinner entertainment. Prices from £478pp for four nights’ accommodation, all-inclusive, with return flights from Gatwick, one piece of 23kg checked luggage per passenger and airport transfers. Departing 2 November. Tui is among the first providers to feature the Riu Palace Tikida, a brand new hotel in Taghazout, less than half an hour away from Agadir. An exceptionally modern hotel, it sits near the Atlantic Coast – just six minutes away from town – and contains its own separate, guest-only beach area. Interiors and facades have traded Moorish or Maghrebi influence in favour of a more European modernity. Spacious rooms feature stylish, wood-floored interiors and large beds, as well as impressive balcony or terrace areas overlooking the pools and landscaped grounds. There are seven swimming pools in total, with a plethora of comfortable seating areas to choose from. Four of these are on the main terrace, while one is indoors and there are two separate, adults-only infinity pools. The spa contains an adults-only gym and Turkish bath, and offers spa treatments and massages. You won’t be let down at meal times either, as there are four bars and four restaurants. Two bars are in the pool areas (one is a swim-up bar), and there’s a lounge bar and one 24-hour lobby bar. Guests can enjoy a poolside restaurant that becomes a steakhouse in the evenings, or check out the Moroccan and Fusion a la carte restaurants or the main restaurant (which serves a mix of international dishes). Do note that for trips to Morocco leaving on or after 1 November, Tui is offering an extra £100 off the price when you spend £800, using the code MOROCCO100. Prices from £955pp for seven nights’ accommodation, all-inclusive, with return flights from Manchester, one piece of 20kg checked luggage per passenger and airport transfers. Departing 2 November. EasyJet features breaks at the Robinson Club, located on a five-mile stretch of golden sand on Agadir Beach. Inside the hotel, sands are replaced by a network of intricate green gardens and winding paths that lead to the white-washed, russet-roofed main buildings. The design is a fusion between modern and old Arabian influences; paths are paved with tiles, gardens feature small fountains and arches and ornaments are Moorish in design. Inside, the common areas are a simple blend of minimalist design and touches of Moroccan influence, while rooms are pared-back and spacious (all come with a balcony or terrace for views over the gardens or out to sea). In addition to the private beach area, facilities include a spa with sauna and wellness area, tennis courts, football pitches and three swimming pools (two of which are outdoors). Dining and drinking options include three bars, one of which is on the beach, one international buffet restaurant and an a la carte beach restaurant. Prices from £962pp for seven nights’ accommodation, all-inclusive, with return flights from Gatwick, one piece of 23kg checked luggage per passenger and airport transfers. Departing 30 October.

      "title": "Glasgow's longest outdoor mural to be created alongside River Clyde",
      "text": "Family-run regeneration business Peel L&P has teamed up with Healy Arts to create an impactful piece of community art named Dancing Wave. The piece, which will be installed within Glasgow Waters, will run alongside the river starting at The Clydeside Community Garden and finishing at Castlebank Street next to the multi-award-winning Riverside Museum. READ NEXT: Event planned to show vision for Glasgow's Golden Z Stretching for more than 500 metres, the piece will celebrate the River Clyde whilst combining Glasgow's rich history of craft heritage with 21st-century technology and design. The river allowed Glasgow to become a major industrial city and at one point the world's largest shipbuilding centre. Following years of decline in the area, The Peel Group has invested £874million into major projects around Scotland, with Glasgow Waters becoming their largest generation project in Scotland. With the vision to become a major retail, leisure and tourism destination on the Clyde, Glasgow Waters will complement, support and revive the surrounding area. The mural will culturally connect different neighbourhoods and future developments within Glasgow Waters, including Yorkhill Quay, Beith Street and the site of the future Therme Scotland. READ NEXT: Bus operator announces increase in frequency of services on two routes Brian Lavalette, property director for Scotland at Peel L&P, said: \"We are very excited for Glasgow Waters to become the home of Glasgow’s longest outdoor mural. \"Working in partnership with local community groups is important to us and we are proud to be working with Healy Arts to deliver this piece which celebrates how significant The River Clyde is to our community and our neighbourhood. \"Dancing Wave will be an excellent and impactful cultural piece of art and we look forward to visitors discovering more about the future of Glasgow Waters whilst enjoying the mural.\" Whilst researching and designing plans for the mural, Healy Arts worked with local groups in Partick, Thornwood and Glasgow Waters to run workshops and experiment with traditional crafts such as glassmaking, mosaic, woodworking and metal forming. Siobhan Healy, founder of Healy Arts who is leading on Dancing Wave, added: \"We at Healy Arts are delighted to be working with our community to create this ambitious artwork beside the River Clyde. \"We have engaged with The Riverside Museum, Glasgow University and the Annexe Healthy Living Centre, to research and develop the concept and to create the artwork.\" The painting of Dancing Wave will officially launch at the Wee Harbour Fest community event on Saturday, August 19 at Meadowside Crescent Quay at Glasgow Waters. Visitors who want to take part in painting a panel of the mural can either pre-register online HERE or they can pick up a paintbrush on the day.",

      "title": "Mobile Phones And Brain Cancer",
      "text": "Dr Biodun Ogungbo is a brain and Spine Surgeon. As an expert, I must trust the information contained in the piece which he graciously forwarded to me and permitted me to publish for which I am eternally grateful. Read it. Internalize it and take a second thought on how you use your mobile phones. Mobile phones can cause brain cancer. Okay, this is not a joke. This is not a topic to profess ignorance about or say, ‘I did not know ’. Just go with the flow and say, ‘Mobile phones can cause brain cancer’. Simply because you don’t want to find out the hard way! Experts believe there is a strong association with prolonged usage of mobile phones especially people who have been using the phones for over 10 years. The risk is also significant in children with their growing and immature brains. It had been predicted that the numbers of patients with newly diagnosed brain cancer and other tumours will almost double by the year 2025. Many countries are seeing an increasing incidence of these horrible tumours now and it’s a worrying trend. Okay, this is not a joke. Glioblastoma Multiforme-We have and are seeing a rise in the numbers of people suffering from high grade brain cancers. These are the types of cancers that defy cure. These cancers, especially the horrible one called Glioblastoma Multiforme or GBM for short, is incurable and kills 100%. This cancer kills the young or the old though it appears more common in patients in their early 60’s. The numbers of sufferers increase with age and it is more common in men. The risk is real and prevention is the main treatment for cancer. Cancer prevention is an action taken to lower the risk of getting cancer. This can include maintaining a healthy lifestyle and taking medicines or vaccines that can prevent cancer from developing. Avoiding exposure to known cancer-causing substances such as sugars, cigarettes and now mobile phones is vital. Studies upon studies Okay! Studies are conflicting and contradictory. Some will find a link and others will not. The risk may be tenuous at best but so what. The American Cancer Society Exit Disclaimer (ACS) states that there could be some cancer risk associated with radiofrequency energy, but the evidence is not strong enough to be considered causal and needs to be investigated further. Brain tumours are particularly difficult to study, for example, because of their high death rate and the short survival of people who develop these tumours. Similarly, patients who survive initial treatment are often impaired, which may affect their responses to questions. Furthermore, for people who have died, next-of-kin are often unable to accurately describe their patterns of phone use to an interviewer. Prevent cancer- Individuals who are concerned about radiofrequency energy exposure can limit their exposure, by using a ear- piece and limiting cell phone use, particularly among children. The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has suggested some steps that concerned cell phone users can take to reduce their exposure to radiofrequency energy Reserve the use of cell phones for shorter conversations or for times when a landline phone is not available. · Use a device with hands-free technology, such as wired headsets, which place more distance between the phone and the head of the user. Hands-free kits reduce the amount of radiofrequency energy exposure to the head because the antenna, which is the source of energy, is not placed against the head. Exposures decline dramatically when cell phones are used hands-free. Okay, this is the score -The decision to limit the use of phones and especially to use a hands free device is entirely yours. You must take the decision to prevent mobile phones from causing you brain cancer. Other issues-There is now strong evidence that the rate of fertility is reducing in many communities around the world. The volume and quality of sperms produced by men is reducing and some feel that it may not be unconnected to mobile phones and computers close to the genital areas in men. Certainly, fertility centres such as Nordic a Fertility centre in Abuja have found an increase in the abnormal sperms seen in specimens and a decrease in the motility. Mobile phones are a great resource and a necessary evil but you have got to take care. Okay, now you know. Here ends the piece by Dr Ogungbo which I find too rich and interesting. I must thank Dr. Ogungbo for his quick approval to use his lovely and timely piece which is an eye opener for me even though I feel very guilty that I procrastinated on the use of this information before it was finally published few years ago when my friend and brother Patrick Adenusi of Safety Beyond Border, a Non-Governmental Organization on road safety alerted with me on a news item on CNN on the same subject. I told myself I must share the stuff but missed out until Dr Ogungbo sent me the material. The decision to limit the use of phones and especially to use a hands free device is entirely yours. I must confess that I got fascinated yet scared when I read through the section on Glioblastoma multiforme which he said is incurable and kills 100 percent. Scarier is the information that it appears more common in patients in their early 60’s and that it is common in men. I do hope that men, those in their 60’s and drivers generally will take special interest in this God sent information. For me I have taken lessons that will now double guide in my usual use of ear piece or Bluetooth which in our clime is seen is show off. Now I have a better understanding of why nine out of ten mobile phone users in some climes outside our shore have become addict in the use of hands free. I hope you will not mistake me for recommending that you go about driving and using hands free since the National Road Traffic Regulations does not allow the use of hands free while driving because of the inherent risk involved.",

      "title": "Historic Paisley painting saved after 225 hours of restoration work",
      "text": "A historic piece of art which was in such bad condition there were fears it would not survive the next decade has been saved after 225 hours of painstaking restoration work. The piece, painted by artist William Barr in 1910, is a reflection of Edwardian Paisley with more than 100 figures of the area’s ‘great and good’ in front of the Town Hall. But over the years its condition deteriorated significantly as a result of poor storage, layers of varnish and water damage. OneRen’s curator of art, Dr Victoria Irvine, says that it was “probably the most damaged” painting in Renfrewshire’s collection. She told STV News: “We would never have been able to display it so to have this work done on this individual painting is significant, it’s huge. “When I first saw it, it was remarkable really. “To be able to actually see some of those details which had been missing for so long under layers of soot and varnish and all that de-lamination, the painting actually coming away from the canvas. “It means that it’s preserved for people of Paisley, people of Renfrewshire and beyond and it means that people can come, see it and really take what they want to take from it.” The restoration work, which has been carried out as part of the £45m refurbishment of Paisley Museum, has been completed by a team of conservators in Dundee. Gail Egan, along with two of her colleagues at Egan, Matthews & Rose, worked on the piece. She said the team don’t often get paintings “which have this much in the way of issues”. “Initially we couldn’t even take the surface dirt off because the paint layer was so vulnerable so we had to put additional facing on even to clean the reverse of the picture. “It had been stored on its side, there had been a leak and plaster in the water had fallen down over the frame mainly on the back of the painting and this had caused the paint and ground layers to tent up as the canvas shrank due to the effects of the water. “Unfortunately the water damage was right through the portraits and obviously we wanted to ensure that we didn’t have anymore paint loss so we had to treat the painting and it was quite a complex treatment,” she explained. William Barr moved to the United States shortly after painting the piece where he remained for the rest of his life. His great-granddaughter, Laurell Brown, has inherited a number of his paintings from her great aunt, Margaret. She remembers growing up in a house in Florida where “the walls were filled with William Barr paintings”. Laurell reached out to the team at Paisley Museum and has been assisting them with their research. She says the restoration of this piece is a “dream come true” for the family. “It’s just a huge honour. “I’m so, so thrilled that his dedication and his skill and his talent as an artist are going to be enjoyed by so many people, it’s really wonderful. “The skill, the patience, the talent, the dedication and how many hours it must’ve taken him. “I’m very proud to be his descendant,” she added. The painting will eventually go on display in Paisley Museum when it reopens in 2024.",

      "text": "It’s been described as one of Birmingham’s ‘most important buildings’ - but for decades the Smallbrook RIngway Centre has been left to rot. The Ringway Centre first opened in 1962 as a defining piece of brutalist architecture in the city - but its future hangs in the balance. There are controversial plans to demolish the building and replace it with three towering residential buildings that will hold around 1,700 apartments. These plans are due to go before Birmingham City Council's planning committee in the coming weeks. After a recent fire in the Ringway Centre, emergency services told BirminghamLive the asbestos-ridden building was being used by the homeless. But an army of volunteers are fighting to save the Ringway Centre from demolition and want to see it restored to its former glory. READ MORE: The tragic Crooked House timeline - and how it went from bad to worse in five months Firefighters were called to a blaze at the derelict office block earlier this week. New pictures from inside the building show how it has been targeted by vandals and badly damaged by leaks in the crumbling ceiling. Despite its rotting condition, several community groups are working to preserve the famous building. Joe Holyoak - an architect and member of the Save Smallbrook Ringway campaign group - said: “The Smallbrook Ringway Centre has been described as the ‘best piece of mid-20th century urban design in the city’ - which is a view that I agree with. “It’s an exceptional piece of 1960s architecture. Unfortunately it’s not statutorily listed but it should be in my view. I’m part of a group who think it should be preserved and converted for new uses. “From an environmental standpoint, the demolition of old buildings and their replacement by new buildings release huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. The decision to leave the big Commonwealth Games banner up a year after the Game’s have finished to conceal the Ringway centre is a cynical move. \"It’s an attempt to make the building invisible - we think it’s an adornment of the city. If the Ringway Centre is demolished, Birmingham would be losing a very fine building capable of re-use - a piece of history.” Mary Keating is a member of Brutiful Brum - a campaign group working to protect brutalist architecture in the city. She said: “We have been campaigning to save the Ringway Centre since 2016, essentially because it’s an amazing building. “It’s very unique and an important piece of brutalist architecture. It’s disgusting what could happen to the Ringway Centre. It’s a big chunk of Birmingham’s history. \"We’ve got a counter-proposal of what we’d like to see where the building can be retained and repurposed as housing. There’s a psychological factor at play too, you take a building of this significance down, suddenly Birmingham doesn’t feel like the place you grew up in anymore.” Still clad in a purple Commonwealth Games banner, a decision on the future of the building is due over the summer. The demolition programme is due to last around 18 months, with each new building expected to take three to four years to be constructed. Owners CEG said it was working with local community partners on ways the site could be used in the intervening period following the demolition. They say a public consultation between 28 June and 18 July last year was held and justified the plans to be submitted to the city council.",

      "title": "An Tinne (The Link) traces a special Clearances journey for Blas",
      "text": "A musical piece by Skye Gaelic singer, Anne Martin, which features songs and stories from Scots, Gaelic, modern Australian and First Nation artists will be performed in Resolis, Croy and Inverinate as part of the Blas Festival next month. Part of it is a piece by Richard Frankland of Australia’s Gunditjmara people to help address the impact settlers made on the Aboriginal people. The full line-up for the performance includes traditional song and new works by Pàdraig Mackay, Gerda Stevenson, Anna Murray, Anna-Wendy Stevenson, Ingrid Henderson, Hannah Moule and Maggie Rigby from Australia and a recording of Richard Frankland’s commissioned piece. Anne answered some questions about An Tinne. Q Where did the first idea for the piece come from for you? A: I’m from the north end of Skye and I have been singing songs from the area all my life and it struck me that there were very few songs from Greaulainn in Kilmuir, Skye – just one. I had been in Australia singing in 2007 and had been asked by someone there, Stuart MacPherson, ‘Which part of Kilmuir are you from?’ and it turned out his people were from Greaulainn. We chatted and developed a friendship and have been across to visit each other. Above their fireplace is a a slabhraidh – the hook and chain that held a cooking pot over a fire – that his ancestors took to Australia as part of their journey from the Clearances. [Along with a book of songs collected in Trotternish by Katie Douglas in the 1930s, the idea began to form for Anne for the project that has become An Tinne, which was originally commissioned by SEALL for the 2022 Year of Scotland’s Stories.] Q You decided to have other voices invited to be part of the whole story of the MacPhersons’ journey. In 1852, Donald and Anne MacPherson left the now abandoned township of Greaulainn, in Kilmuir on Skye, boarding a ship to Geelong, Victoria. Along with a Gaelic bible, the slabhraidh was their most precious possession? A: To Stuart’s family, the hook is a link to the other side of the world and another time. But there is another side to the Clearances, a story not often told, that of the injustices done to the Aboriginal people. We commissioned Richard Frankland of the Gunditjmara people to help address that omission. And Richard has produced a relevant, moving and powerful piece. Q For people who might not know your own work, Anne, how did you come to music and performing? A: I was born and brought up in Trotternish on the Isle of Skye where she learnt a wealth of her tradition from older neighbours and relatives and have been singing and researching Gaelic song since I was a child. Having sung in America, Australia, Canada, Europe and India, I have performed at large festivals, concert halls, and lots of small and intimate village halls too! Q The show was presented on Skye last year, but now it will be performed again three times as part of Blas in a few weeks’ time? A Yes, we will be taking An Tinne as part of the Blas Festival to Resolis on September 7, Croy on September 8 and Inverinate on September 9, the final night of the festival. The Blas Festival, which runs from September 1-9, organised by Fèisean nan Gàidheal in partnership with Highland Council, showcases Gaelic culture and the Scottish traditional music scene over nine days of events in venues across the Highlands and Islands.

      "text": "Article content What they created was piece dedicated to their Kitchener Eastwood Collegiate high school art teacher Sandy Bethell. Titled “Sandy with the Wavy Hair,” the piece featured a woman’s face, her hair flowing to the side and into a twisted mound. As you go around to the back of the piece, a ship emerges from the hair. “We had a lot of people thinking it was Moana or Medusa or whatever,” said Vanderkooy. “There were some really interesting interpretations. It was great.” Their creation was one of about half a dozen family entries at the beach on Saturday, which also included a dragon, a giant squid, castles and the Toronto Blue Jays logo. They ended up winning second place, taking home a gift bag and gift certificate. There were also a pair of entries in the professional category. There was a towering piece featuring a selection of birds, including owls, ducks, geese, and more all set in the fanned out tail of a peacock. Another piece featured a bear paddling a canoe. Put on by the Sauble Beach Chamber of Commerce, Saturday’s festivities also included musical entertainment at the town square in the evening. It was to continue on Sunday morning with Church in the Square presented by Sauble Christian Fellowship. A Sunday evening concert in the square was to feature musician Brooke Nicholls from 7 to 9 p.m.",

The pair, who finished the show in second place, were seen hand in hand at a London awards ceremony in October 2022. They were later sat arm in arm together. The pictures emerged just days after Great British Bake Off star Mr Whaite, 34, revealed he and his fiancé and partner of 15 years Paul Atkins 'spent some time apart' after he opened up about his feelings towards the South African dancer. Onlookers at the event, which was held at the Camden Roundhouse in North London nine months ago, were surprised at how openly affectionate they were. The pair, who won the Attitude Gamechanger Award at the Virgin Atlantic Attitude Awards for breaking ground for Strictly's first same sex coupling 'could not keep their hands off each other.' Close bond: Strictly star John Whaite couldn't keep his hands off his professional dance partner Johannes Radebe a year after they performed together on the BBC One show, new pictures reveal Connection: The pair were seen hand in hand at an awards ceremony in London in October 2022. They were later sat arm in arm together Partner: The pictures emerged just days after Great British Bake Off star Mr Whaite, 34, revealed that he and his fiancé and partner of 15 years Paul Atkins 'spent some time apart' after he opened up about his feelings towards the South African dancer An onlooker said: 'If there was a night which showed how close they were, then this was it. John wore a deep cut V neck see-through shirt at the event and all his chest muscles which he flaunted on Strictly were clearly on show for everyone to see and Johannes seemed to love it all. 'But the pair left no-one in doubt they could have been an item that night. The pair sat next to each other all night and at one point were arm in arm. They clearly seemed a couple. It was very romantic to watch. They were inseparable. 'Throughout the evening the pair looked into each other's eyes and held hands. At one point John had his arm around John's waist at their table for everyone to see and Johannes had his arm around John. 'The pair stayed until the end of the night and held hands as they walked down the staircase at the Roundhouse. The pair were careful not to be photographed together hand in hand as they stepped outside the venue after midnight to avoid waiting photographers. 'There was one telling moment as they left. Johannes looked visibly upset as John left him behind to get into his waiting car and Johannes was seen confiding his feelings to a friend who was with him on the night that they had to be split apart due to photographers surrounding the venue who were eager to get a photo of them leaving together. 'They clearly looked together but at the time were careful not to share it with everyone as their close bond was not an open secret at the time, unlike it is now.' In an interview to promote his book. Mr Whaite admitted 'still loves' Johannes but said he believes being in regular contact would be disrespectful to his partner. PDA: Onlookers at the event, which was held at the Camden Roundhouse in North London nine months ago, were surprised at how openly affectionate they were Speculation: The pair, who won the Attitude Gamechanger Award at the Virgin Atlantic Attitude Awards for breaking ground for Strictly's first same sex coupling 'could not keep their hands off each other Discussing his time on the show with Johannes, he told The Times: 'When you're physically pressed against another man for ten hours a day, things move emotionally. So I fell in love with him [Johannes]. I still love him, of course I do.' 'I can't speak for him – because I'm not allowed to, legally – but it felt like there was love there.'We had such similar stories growing up – the homophobia, the bullying, coming out, coming to terms with our sexuality – as any queer kid would.' Mr Whaite and Mr Radebe were the first ever male same-sex pairing on the show and made it to the final two, before being beaten by Rose Ayling-Ellis and Giovanni Pernice. The TV personality admitted his feelings about Mr Radebe to Mr Atkins and the couple spent some time apart following the honest conversation. Mr Atkins moved back in with his parents, while Mr Whaite recalled sitting 'on the patio, drinking bottle after bottle of sauvignon blanc'. However, Mr Whaite has said the couple managed to put the issue behind them as they didn't want to throw away the history they had together. Shock: John recently told how he 'fell in love' with his dance partner Johannes during their time together competing on Strictly Come Dancing VICTIMS OF THE STRICTLY CURSE A look back at when The Curse struck... starting all the way back with series 1 Series 1: Natasha Kaplinsky and Brendan Cole Strictly hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons during season one. Viewers were transfixed by the apparent close bond between newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky and her hunky partner Brendan Cole. Did they/didn't they? Natasha and her hunky partner Cole sparked affair rumours Although the pair went on to win the show, their success was blighted by affair rumours. BBC presenter Natasha soon split from long-term partner Mike Barnard while Brendan dumped his fiancée and fellow dancer Camilla Dallerup. Writing in her book Strictly Inspirational, Camilla said their split was like a 'mini death'. 'You go through the arc of grief, anger, bitterness,' she said. 'My best friend and dancing professionally with Brendan had both gone.' However, Natasha has always denied any wrongdoing, saying: 'There was chemistry, of course, and I certainly fell in love with dancing, but I did not fall in love with Brendan.' Series 5: Matt Di Angelo and Flavia Cacace Of all the Strictly romances there's been over the years, this remains one of the most interesting. Clandestine: Before long gossip was raging about how Flavia and Matt, then 19, were secretly in love Flavia Cacace was in a long-term relationship with her dance partner Vincent Simone when she was partnered with Matt Di Angelo in 2007. He was eight years her junior. Before long gossip was raging about how Flavia and Matt, then 19, were secretly in love. Shortly after the show finished she called time on her romance with Vincent and went public with Matt. Looking back at their partnership, Matt told Daily Mail: ‘It was a pretty crazy time. It was front page news. 'The funny thing was the story did not start off as true, but the more you read it, the more you started to believe it and actually act on it.' Their romance ended in 2010, and a few weeks later Flavia admitted she was dating her latest dance partner, actor Jimi Mistry, who she went on to marry. Series 7: Joe Calzaghe and Kristina Rihanoff Not to be: Kristina is said to have also wanted children while Joe already has two sons from a previous relationship Over: Unfortunately for Kara and Artem their relationship didn't go the distance Scandal: Kristina was recently forced to defend her romance with Ben Former boxer Joe Calzaghe split with his girlfriend of five years Jo-Emma Larvin just a week into the show in 2009. The sportsman began a relationship with Russian dancer Kristina Rihanoff soon afterwards. The pair enjoyed a four-year romance but parted ways after Joe reportedly asked Kristina not to accept a role dancing in a stage production. Speaking to Hello! Kristina said: 'He was sick and tired of waiting around for me, and said that if I truly loved him, I wouldn’t have taken the job in the West End.' Kristina is said to have also wanted children while Joe already has two sons from a previous relationship. Series 8: Kara Tointon and Artem Chigvintsev Unfortunately for Kara Tointon and Artem Chigvintsev their relationship didn't manage to go the distance. After winning the show in 2010 the pair hooked up, love quickly blossomed and they moved into a London home together. However, it’s believed Russian Artem’s visa issues saw him having to spend time apart from Kara for months on end and they eventually decided to call it a day. Actress Kara welcomed her baby son, Frey with fiancé Marius Jensen in 2018, while Artem has struck up a romance with retired WWE wrestler, Nikki Bella since moving to the US to compete on Dancing With the Stars in 2014. Series 11: Ben Cohen and Kristina Rihanoff Kristina Rihanoff was recently forced to defend her romance with Strictly partner Ben Cohen insisting that their relationship only began once his 11 year marriage to wife Abby had come to an end. 'He left his wife a year ago,' she told Daily Mirror. 'Recently we started dating but we're allowed to see each other as two single people.' Kristina – who has also dated Vincent Simone and ex partner Joe Calzaghe – said there have been other couples, yet she is the only one to be 'attacked'. She said: 'Ben's said it many times and I'll say it again - I wasn't involved in the breaking up of his marriage.' Meanwhile Abby described the split and resultant divorce as 'the most traumatic thing to ever happen to me'. Ben, 37, met Abby in 1995 at the age of 17, and the couple married in 2003 before welcoming their daughters in 2008. Series 11: Rachel Riley and Pasha Kovalev 'It doesn't exist!' Rachel brushed aside the fact that The Curse exists, after she left her husband and got together with Pasha On the same series, Countdown's math whiz Rachel Riley's relationship with her pro partner Pasha Kovalev ultimately ended her marriage to her husband of just one year. She wed Jamie Gilbert in 2012, taking part on 2013's season of the dancing show. By the end of 2013, they had split and she was with Pasha - which she claims began after the show came to an end. 'On Strictly, you form a close bond with your partner, but there was nothing romantic when Pasha and I were dancing. It was just dancing,' she told the Mail the following January, insisting there's no such thing as The Curse. '[Strictly] serves as a magnifying glass that shows up pre-existing fault lines,' she said, explaining the situation. She is still with Pasha today. Series 11: Susanna Reid Epiphany: Shortly after the show ended, Susanna split from her long-term partner Dominic Cotton Divorcee: Actress Sunetra also announced her marriage split after starring on Strictly Susanna Reid was another victim of series 11. She was billed as the most popular breakfast TV host and in a 15-year -relationship when she reached the Strictly Come Dancing final that year. However shortly after the show ended, the TV host split from her long-term partner Dominic Cotton. However, mother-of-three Susanna, who was paired with professional Kevin Clifton, said the programme was not to blame for her love problems. Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna told Daily Mirror: 'I think people think Strictly was bound up in what happened. It wasn’t. Obviously things have been challenging in my personal life but we are getting things sorted.' Series 12: Sunetra Sarker Actress Sunetra Sarker also announced her marriage split after starring on Strictly. She parted ways with her husband Nick Corfield after ten years of marriage just before the programme hit the screens. The couple first met in 1989 while on holiday in Jersey and have a 13-year-old son together. However, she said the romance had ended long before her reality show stint: 'The truth is three years ago me and my husband amicably split up and it obviously had nothing to do with Strictly.' The Casualty actress, who plays Dr Zoe Hanna in the BBC medical drama, is now said to be dating business partner Scott Carey. Together, the pair set up the food firm Keep Me Fresh. Series 12: Caroline Flack Caroline Flack broke up with her boyfriend of a year and a half, Jack Street, after making her way into the Strictly Come Dancing semi-final. The price of success: Caroline Flack broke up with her boyfriend of a year and a half, Jack Street, after making her way into the Strictly Come Dancing semi-final According to The Sun, she was 'distraught' backstage at the BBC show, but managed to put on a brave face to wow with her Tango and top the leader board. A source close to her told the newspaper: 'It came to a natural end and was mutual.' Some contestants have ended relationships to engage in a romance with their dance partner on the show, but the source noted that in Caroline's case, this wasn't the reason. 'No one else is involved,' they stated. Caroline had been seeing music manager Jack for around 18 months and she previously said that he was fine with her working on the talent show despite its reputation. 'Jack's been completely fine about the whole curse thing,' she said, quoted in The Mirror. 'He hasn't once been worried'. Series 13: Helen George Over and out: Helen announced her split from husband of three years Oliver Boot, after she was revealed as a contestant (pictured with pro Aljaz Skorjanec) It did not take long before the dreaded curse of Strictly struck again. Actress Helen George announced her split from husband of three years, fellow actor Oliver Boot, after she was revealed as a contestant on the show. 'I can confirm that Helen separated from her husband some time ago,' a spokesperson for the star said. She has not been linked to any fellow Strictly contestants or professional dancers. A Royal Academy Of Music graduate, Helen is best known for starring as Nurse Beatrix 'Trixie' Franklin in the hit BBC period drama Call The Midwife. George has also performed as a back-up singer for Sir Elton John and starred in a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Zippel called The Woman In White. She met her former partner on set of BBC drama Hotel Babylon, and the couple married in December 2012. Series 13: Georgia May Foote The actress was in a relationship with her Coronation Street co-star Sean Ward when she took part in the 2015 series of the show. Break-up: Shortly after Georgina finished runner-up in the final, she announced her split from Sean But cracks began to show as it was reported that Sean was enraged with jealousy over her decision to take part, and even allegedly accompanied her to rehearsals at the beginning of her Strictly journey. Shortly after she finished runner-up in the final, she and Sean announced their split - with Georgia seen kissing her dance partner Giovanni Pernice during a romantic trip to Disneyland soon after. However, shortly before rehearsals for the 2016 series began, Georgia and Giovanni called time on their romance after just a year. Giovanni has since moved on with 2018 contestant and former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, while Georgia is dating rapper Kris Evans. Series 14: Louise and Jamie Redknapp Divorced: Louise Redknapp appeared on the series in 2016, after which she and Jamie were said to be facing marital issues Footballer Jamie Redknapp is said to have been offered a place on the Strictly line-up recently, but understandably has refused after the series was blamed for the demise of his marriage to wife Louise. Louise appeared on the series in 2016, after which she and Jamie were said to be facing marital issues. By the end of 2017, they were divorced. It was highly-speculated that Louise realised, during the show, that she wanted to get back to work having sacrificed her career for her marriage - with co-star Daisy Lowe said to have helped her 'rediscover her youth'. A TV source said: 'Strictly used to be show that no celebrity ever turned down. But the Curse has changed all that. There is now a genuine concern that appearing on the show can negatively impact relationships. Jamie only has negative feelings about Strictly now. There’s absolutely no way he would appear.' Louise was also rumoured to have struck up a romantic bond with her pro partner Kevin Clifton, but this has never been confirmed. Series 14: Kevin and Karen Clifton Split: The Cliftons - a married pair of pro dancers - split romantically in 2018 Despite the rumours surrounding thrice-married Kevin while he partnered with Louise, nothing seemed to transpire between the two. He was, of course, married at the time too - to fellow pro Karen Clifton. However, since then, the pair have split up. Kevin proposed to her, on her birthday, on stage during a performance of Burn the Floor and they wed in July 2015. But in March 2018, they confirmed that they were no longer together romantically. They have since continued to work together as a pro dance partnership, however, insisting there is no bad blood. Series 16: Stacey Dooley, Sam Tucknott and Kevin Clifton We're done: Stacey's boyfriend of five years Sam Tucknott, 30, revealed Stacey had left him in an interview with the Mail On Sunday Stacey's boyfriend of five years Sam Tucknott, 30, revealed Stacey had left him in an interview with the Mail On Sunday in April. He called her dance partner, three-times married Kevin Clifton, 36, a slippery snake Sam confronted Kevin in furious video chat where he branded him a 'proper rat'. He told MoS in an exclusive interview he feels betrayed by the new couple's romance. It has been alleged that Stacey and Kevin's relationship was an 'open secret' on the Strictly tour News has cast shadow over latest series of show, resurrecting the so-called 'Strictly curse' that has seen 14 couples split. The TV presenter, 32, broke her silence on Twitter soon after, insisting there 'are two sides to every story' All over: In August 2019, just ahead of series 17, Neil and Katya announced their split after 11 years of marriage Series 16/17: Katya and Neil Jones 2018 saw The Curse strike early on in the season, with drama escalating just three weeks into the live shows. In a new twist, a love square formed when Katya Jones, who is married to fellow show professional Neil, was snapped all over her celeb partner, comedian Seann Walsh, on the street outside a pub in London. This took part on Sean's girlfriend's - actress and writer Rebecca Humphries - birthday, no less. Dumped: Neil and Katya's break-up comes 10 months after her kiss with Seann (pictured with ex-girlfriend Rebecca Humphries) The pair brushed it off as a 'one-off mistake', despite them kissing and laughing brazenly in public. Since then, Rebecca 'dumped' Seann via a Twitter statement. Seann and Katya did not pull out of the show, with their dalliance a gigantic elephant in the room as they still performed on the series, with Neil on set too. However, In August 2019, just ahead of series 17, Neil and Katya announced their split after 11 years of marriage. The break-up coming just 10 months after her kiss with Seann. Series 18: Nadiya Bychkova, Matija Škarabot and Kai Widdrington In January 2022, Nadiya revealed she had split from her fiancé Matija Škarabot, with whom she shares her five-old daughter. New couple: Fellow professional dancers Nadiya and Kai struck up a romance after she split from her fiancé Matija The news broke shortly after she had partnered with married BBC Breakfast host Dan Walker and there were rumours of a romance, which they were quick to dispel. The professional dancer later revealed that she had in fact secretly split from her fiancé before series 18 had even began and during that time she struck up a dancer with fellow pro Kai - who had been romantically linked to his partner that series - AJ Odudu. While Nadiya did not disclose exactly when she and Kai started dating she said in her first interview about their romance that she found him to be 'He’s kind and compassionate and makes me laugh. I feel very relaxed with him.’ Series 18: Max George, Stacey Giggs and Maisie Smith Dancing through life: Max and Maisie struck up a romance after appearing on series 18 of the hit show together When Max appeared on series 18 of Strictly he was happily loved-up with Stacey, whom he had been dating for four years, with the singer taking on the role of stepfather to her two children. Yet months after appearing on the show he began a relationship with fellow series 18 star Maisie Smith, who had been linked to singer HRVY during her initial time on the show. Yet Max and Maisie are said to have grown close on the Strictly live tour, which took place a couple of months after they appeared on the show together. Stacey then accused her ex of cheating on her with Maisie and reportedly felt 'betrayed' by her former beau. Series 19: Adam Peaty and Eirianedd Munro Sad: Adam Peaty has split from his girlfriend Eirianedd Munro after three years together and apologised for 'letting down' his partner and their son In an Instagram statement in August 2022, Olympic swimmer Adam took to Instagram to confirm that he and his girlfriend Eirianedd Munro had split after three years together. He said that the couple had decided to go 'their separate ways' but that their son George, who is two next month, remained their 'priority'. Announcing the news via social media, Adam wrote: 'Eiri and George, I'm sorry for letting you down. My only interest is for the well-being of our family at this difficult time.' The split comes Adam raised eyebrows with his chemistry with pro partner Katya Jones on the dance floor last year, with eagle-eyed fans claiming they thought that they nearly kissed at the end of one steamy routine. After the incident, Eirianedd admitted she had been 'really emotional' after her sportsman beau's 'near kiss' with Katya. Eirianedd, told fans she took a 'short break' from social media after Adam and Katya got very close at the end of their racy Argentine Tango last autumn.

      "title": "Quality Street announces huge new product update featuring two most popular flavours",
      "text": "Quality Street is set to delight fans by releasing a sensational new chocolate bar featuring a combinatoin of two of the nation's most beloved flavours. The company - owned by Nestlé - have announced the arrival of a 'stellar collaboration' - a delicious fusion of the Green Triangle and The Purple One. This collaboration is set to shake up the sharing bar experience like never before by combining the two flavourful fan favourites. The new Quality Street Collusions bar will contain three layers of 'textured deliciousness,' combining caramel and creamy hazelnut filling as well as crunchy hazelnut pieces. Quality Street are releasing a sensational new chocolate bar which sees the merging of two of the nation's most beloved flavours Samantha Hirst, Brand Manager for Quality Street at Nestlé UK and Ireland, said: 'We’re sure that Quality Street fans will love the fact that two favourites have been brought together to make a triple-layered treat that’s perfect for gifting or sharing with family and friends.' Quality Street Collisions sharing bar is currently available exclusively in Asda, and will be rolled out to supermarkets and convenience stores nationwide later this month. The 235g Quality Street Collisions sharing bar is the first flavour collision and the third addition to the Quality Street sharing bar range. The Quality Street sharing bars were first introduced in 2022, with the Purple One and the Orange Crunch being the first two classics out of the bunch to break out of the iconic purple tin. These flavours were reimagined to create a delicious new way to enjoy the creamy confections, especially perfect for cozy nights in. The Purple One was released as a triple-layered treat consisting of milk chocolate, oozing, runny caramel and sprinkled with a layer of hazelnut pieces. ‘Orange Crunch’ contains smooth chocolate with an indulgent orange chocolate filling and scrumptious crunchy pieces, adding a crunch to every bite. The sharing bars, alongside their new addition to the family, come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and flavours to suit everyone's tastes and preferences. The new Quality Street Collusions bar will feature a delicious fusion of the Green Triangle and The Purple One - an explosive mixture of caramel, smooth hazelnut and hazelnut pieces Quality Street is one of the most popular variety tins of chocolate in Britain - dating back to 1936 when the first ever tin was produced and sold for just two shillings. According to the Quality Street website, the original tin contained a mix of a whopping 18 individually wrapped sweets, including 11 chocolates and seven toffees. During World War II, production of many confectionary lines were halted due to rationing and shortages. Quality Street continued to be produced, but with far fewer sweets. After the end of the war, the brand continued to thrive, but had to make one significant change: the Brazil nut originally used in The Purple One had to be replaced with a hazelnut due to wartime shortages. This brings us to the current Purple product that the nation knows and loves today - inarguably even becoming one of the most cherished flavours in the box. Tins of Quality Street often pose a dilemma among families, as there never seems to be enough of The Purple Ones, Green Triangles and other favourites to go round. However, one savvy mum from West Sussex decided to take matters into her own hands in 2018, as she began creating custom boxes of Quality Street tubs filled with just ONE type of chocolate for fussy fans.",

      "title": "Q&amp;A With Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Head of Art Investing: Art as an Asset Class",
      "text": "Art can be a confusing property to own. Do you buy a work of art for what it is or the potential to appreciate in value? If a wealthy family owns a sizable collection of artworks passed down from generation to generation, does it matter how much it’s worth even if they are never going to sell it? There are no clear answers to any of those questions but art collectors are increasingly asking them. That’s where Morgan Stanley (MS)’s Art Resources Team (ART), a unit under the investment bank’s Private Wealth Management division, comes in. “Art represents a growing component of many investors’ balance sheets but is often overlooked in the context of wealth management,” says its website. The ART team is headed by Sarah McDaniel, a seasoned investment manager with more than 20 years of experience holding various roles at Morgan Stanley. “I’m a curious person and I love learning,” McDaniel told Observer. “I love working with clients and figuring out how to take complex issues, distill them down, and come up with solutions.” McDaniel has a degree in Art History from Dartmouth College, but never thought she would have a career in art and was fine keeping it as a hobby. After college, McDaniel began her career managing taxes and estates at Christie’s Auction House and later moved into wealth management. In an interview earlier this month, McDaniel discussed how her team at Morgan Stanley helps clients apply investing disciplines from traditional asset classes to art, the unique role of art in wealth management, and the constant debate over art being a passion asset vs. a financial asset. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Observer: Tell me about Morgan Stanley’s Art Resources Team (ART). Who does serve and what does it do, exactly? Sarah McDaniel: The ART team helps clients understand the role of art on their balance sheet. For example, how valuable and liquid is a client’s art collection? How concentrated is it on one artist or genre? We take the disciplines from other solutions and services at Morgan Stanley and try to translate them into art and bring context to an art portfolio. We work with multi-generational family offices and also those new to the art world, such as entrepreneurs and corporate executives who are starting to form their taste in art. Do you advise clients on buying and selling art? Not directly. The ART team provides a third-party platform of art advisors who advise clients on buying and selling decisions. We work in conjunction with them and define what portion of a client’s balance sheet is suitable to include art and collectibles. Collectibles include furniture, jewelry and wine. Can you give me a sense of how big the private art market is and how significant art is in a typical client’s investment portfolio? Studies have shown that anywhere between 10 and 15 percent of an ultra-high-net-worth balance sheet is art and collectibles. In aggregate, the global total value of art in private collections is between $2 to $3 trillion. And it’s estimated there are $60 billion worth of art transactions happening a year. With the turnover in the billions of dollars and the total asset base being significantly larger, you can imagine art is a very illiquid asset. It’s also a negative cash-flow asset because there are insurance, storage costs, restoration costs, etc. So it’s really important for us to have contextual conversations with clients about liquidity, holding costs, governance, philanthropy—all those topics. Many investors own art in the hope of it being a positive capital appreciation asset, but a lot of times it’s a capital loss. Our goal is to make art an appreciative asset, not a liability. When exactly did art become an asset class? Since the early 2000s, there have been art funds managed by private equity firms. Some have been more successful than others. Some are still in the market. So it has been at least that long since people considered art as an asset. More recently, I think the rise of buying and selling online is an indication of more people seeing art as an investment. You mentioned you work with both multi-generational collectors and newbies to the art world. I suppose they have different tastes and investing habits when it comes to art. Is it true? Some people think of art as a passion asset, and some think of it as a financial asset. When we talk to people with inherited wealth, generally they think of art as a passion asset, because they collected it and lived with it for multiple generations. But in the event of generational wealth transfer, it’s necessary to think of art as a financial asset from the perspectives of governance and philanthropy. For example, when an art collection is passed down, should the inheritor sell it, donate it, or do something else with it? Those new to the art market—people who may come from tech, real estate and finance—tend to bring their business acumen to the art world. So they are more inclined to look at art as a financial asset. For example, real estate is a bit like art in that each asset is unique and valuation can be challenging. Sometimes there aren’t any comparables; they are highly illiquid; buying and selling aren’t as frequent as other asset classes; and transactional costs are considerable. That’s an interesting analogy. Does art investing follow the same principles as real estate investing? A house might be a big, lumpy purchase. But with art, you might not want to do that right away. Within private wealth management, we work with clients with a total net worth of approximately $25 million or higher. Within ultra-high-net-worth clients—it’s usually not one individual, but a family—total net worth can go up significantly. Generally, lower net worth clients may not buy one oil painting because of concentration risk with one artist or one genre. Advisors might recommend photographs and prints that tend to be less pricey because they are multiples and can potentially be sold more easily. Over time, as their net worth increases, so does their purchasing power of art. And they might trade up in quality and medium. Is there such a thing as buying a portion of one piece of artwork? Yes. Actually, on the higher end of the market, we are starting to see fractionalization. In some cases, a work of art is fractionalized into equal shares. I’ve also seen people buying specific, unique portions of one piece of art. Is fractionalization a good investment strategy? It’s making art more accessible on the high end of the market. But one challenge with art fractionalization is diversification. It’s slow to get to a well-diversified portfolio. I think what’s really important is reaching a critical mass of lots of different artists and lots of pieces so that buyers not only get access but also the ability to diversify. Generally speaking, what determines the value of an artwork? There’s the artist itself, the medium (for example, drawing, watercolor and print tend to be less dear than sculpture or oil painting), the quality of the piece and its condition, and the significance of that work of art in its time period. In addition, having the provenance to track from the artist to whoever owns it now is incredibly important. And then, there’s the economics of taste, which affects demand. There are taste variations within collecting categories in the U.S. and across the globe. These are all factors affecting the valuation of a work of art. What about macroeconomic factors, like interest rates or economic cycles? Do they affect the value of art? The long-term cycles of the financial market ebb and flow. So does the art market. The art market tends to lag behind the other parts of the economy because of the infrequency of trading. We find through data that what happens within the art market—especially the higher end of the market—is that when the financial market is ebbing, there tends to be less art on and up for sale. Some of the ebbs and flows of the art market are purely supply-based: If you don’t have to sell a piece of art, why would you want to sell it in a bad market? It feels like art is somewhat like luxury goods in the sense that it has the potential to appreciate in value, but, even if it doesn’t, you can still enjoy it. We’ve seen in Covid and previous economic cycles that the luxury sector tends to fair better during economic downturns. Does it apply to the art market? Is art as a recession-proof investment? I don’t think anything is totally recession-proof. At some point, there will be a repricing of all financial assets. In my opinion, the real challenge to the art market is not the financial market, but the great generational wealth transfer. There are tens of trillions of dollars transferring from one generation to another. People are living longer, and technology is providing an opportunity for people to transact more. For example, someone’s grandparents have passed away and their art collection is in the hands of the second or third generation. By that time, there might be a disconnect in the economics of taste. That means short-term trends and taste changes might happen faster, so we might see highs and lows more often. What do you think is the #1 misconception about investing in art as an asset? I want to stress it’s much easier to buy art than to sell it. When you buy a work of art, the important thing is not the purchase, but to consider whether there’s a secondary market that can provide liquidity to get in and out. For someone who’s interested in investing in art, do you have tips on how to get started and learn about the market? I would suggest going to auction houses. Many are open to the public. Look at the art that’s being bought and sold. Auction houses have two big sales events a year. The volume of properties going through those events is almost like having an art history degree. It’s incredibly exciting. Talk to specialists who are knowledgeable about galleries and art fairs. Ask questions. They love talking about art. You’ll learn about the art itself, how it got to that location, and all the nuances of the story. You have a college degree in art history. Do you have a favorite artist or art genre? Taste changes over time. When I was studying art history, I liked Impressionism and Modernism. I still do. But what I find after working in the art world is that the art market is very different from art history. It’s about theory and practice, and strategy and implementation. Learning what’s actually bought and sold in the market, I became more interested in the contemporaries and different media. For me, it’s not only the aesthetic part of the art, but the story of the artist and how they convey their views and beliefs through their art. I am a visual thinker. That’s how art resonates with me. So, my taste has evolved, not necessarily from one genre to another, but by building out and appreciating as much of the art market as possible.",

      "title": "'Best ever' Belladrum awaits the debrief",
      "text": "It might be ‘That’s all folks!’ from this year’s cartoon-inspired Belladrum… But the chat continues on everything from the reasons for those massive traffic delays on Thursday – to choosing your favourite act. Hottest topic? Hit the festival’s socials and you’ll get super-contrasting views on shifting the main stage to the Hot House field – the biggest change Belladrum has put itself and the audience through since the start. The milling bodies at the top where toilet queue meets coming and going audience, could be challenging at times over the weekend. But it was easy enough to get clear by heading across the back of the field and moving past the food trucks and Foodie Forest to find a peaceful space to sit or room to walk on for a space at the front barrier in front of the stage. The view from the crest of that hill down and across a crowd that seemed to stay put longer at the stage than ever before – was impressive. So was the sound, bar a bit of echo or delay on the one you couldn't miss Punk Rock Factory listening on the Foodie Factory side! Line-up choices? Inspired ‘line-up wrangling’ – getting the mix of music right – saw a bill of crowd-pleasers for Hot House, such as Thursday’s Skerryvore-Sam Ryder-Sigrid. Friday followed with Colonel Mustard-newcomers Punk Rock Factory-local heroes Elephant Sessions and on to Saturday’s commercial core of Olivia Dean-Scouting For Girls-Peat & Diesel setting up the crowning act of closing headliners, Travis. But this year more than any before, the after-hours acts Gimme Abba, Martin Kemp’s 80s DJ set and the later start final acts in the Grassroots tent, emphasised two different groups in the crowd, those heading home and those staying to camp and party. Who won your top of the headliners prize? Sigrid won perfect opening headliner prize with her youthful exuberance and perfect ending for first-ever Scottish headlining set – wrapped in a Saltire, bringing on Skerryvore’s Scott Wood for a unique sound memory of Strangers for all the young girls and families loving that set. But a little bit samey? Bastille brought frontman and master creator Dan Smith’s’s pop-rock vision back to us, the power of 2013’s Pompeii with dance mash-up Of The Night and latest album Give Me The Future’s Shut Off The Lights. Travis, set off Saturday night getting us to sing along with melody-rich story songs woven through Scotland’s soundtrack of the last 30 years. Frontman Fran kept it real about everything from aging – he was 50 last week – to songs. “I feel like music has been slightly sh*** for a while, and by sh***, I mean sh***,” he said. “Songs should be about something! If you are in a band, then this song is dedicated to you!” The band launched into one of their earliest big-hitters, All I Want To Do Is Rock, about making a stand for music, for anything. But Fran in his Barbie-pink – or was it red – suit had one more thought to share: “Thanks so much for having us, and for your voices. Have a great weekend. Make love not war, and make love tonight and make children – and get them off social media! Throw the phones away, just be cool. You’ll thank me later.” Nice to think a new generation of Belladrummers might have been created on the headliner’s advice! The generation game ... Keeping their different tribes happy is something Belladrum works hard at – the Garden Stage belonged to the younger group – and more mature at different times. Dylan John Thomas on Saturday saw the front of the stage packed with teens and early 20s, a more mature crowd thronging round the stage on Thursday when the delayed Altered Images appeared with hits from their 80s pop hit past and Clare Grogan as glamorous and dangerous in her scarlet gown as you could wish for. But who did you discover? Along the way there were jewels to find at any stage you cared to try, local musicians making the most of a Belladrum slot to take their chance to impress a bigger out-of-town audience stopping by. Macgilli at the Ice-House early on Saturday drew a building crowd with his looped guitar instrumentals, explaining to his audience what he was doing, as they stood silent and mesmerised for the first couple of tracks into Fire and Stone a raw, fast piece. In that, you got to see all his different ways of playing the guitar - as percussion, ghostly harmonics with a light touch of the strings or running a flat hand up the fretboard and swinging his hunched torso around to add power to ferocious strumming. To me, it started to come across as some kind of ballet, his fingers, hands, arms, dancing to the music. Chapters – his latest single raising money for charity - was a total contrast, slow and thoughtful with a poem by his friend Dail Macdonald woven through it in the recorded version. “It’s like Braveheart!” someone in the crowd whispered to her friend as the piece began. And Macgilli’s music has that epic quality. Another homegrown success story is Tik Tok sensation and most recently Ivor Novello songwriter award finalist Katie Gregson-Macleod. The clearly delighted young star was treated to a throng of people at the Grassroots stage on Saturday for her first gig back here since her Highland tour in the early spring. In a set that gave us a reprise of many of the songs from that set -– Body, I’m Worried It Will Always Be You, TV Show which she hopes to release soon, My Second Single Bed – where for the second time she pointed into the crowd, this time saying ‘You got it right, I got it wrong’ to the person singing along with the words. She told us she was worried her mum who was in the crowd would be annoyed she was going to mention smoking. And the sense of how close she felt to this festival – which she reminded us had been her first to perform at – came when she told us that she had been asked to play Bella this year and which stage she would like to play and she had chosen this one, the Grassroots. “This was always my favourite stage – I have seen some amazing people people here - Rachel Sermanni last night!” And Katie asked for help to sing White Lies – “I hate singing it so if you know it, sing it with me …” That means when the last song came next, the voices were warmed up and hearts were open to share Katie’s memories. “I wrote this on Belladrum weekend last year,” Katie shared. And she said at the time, she thought it was a bad song ..! But just before announcing Complex to a giant roar from the crowd, Katie invited us to sing it with her. She revealed in her down-to-earth jokey style that a friend had told her inviting us to sing made her sound like “an arrogant p***k”. But half-crying, and wiping away tears, then half-laughing at the overwhelming sound of everyone singing the song with her, word-perfect, the singer was anything but arrogant, glancing behind her into the crowd to catch the eye of her family? It was a special moment to share. And no Belladrum makes sense without a few new discoveries from more exotic locations to check out. The Seedlings stage, now close to the Hot House and perfectly-placed to keep popping in to check out the best new and hottest indie music, served up Lubana – from Edinburgh – on Thursday night. A chilled RnB pop sound schmoozed across the tent for what frontman Darren told us was their first outing as a four-piece before taking us to Palm Springs, the title of the song. “Oh God, what a mess I made,” the story went. Hooked in by the keyboards and guitar riffs, the good news for the busy crowd of people was that the teaser for their single was one thing to check out – the second, that they’d be back at the Tooth & Claw in Inverness on October 20. Forgetting The Future conquered at the same stage on Saturday (see an interview with the band's Robbie McNicol and Sam Cowan on Inverness Courier online). And it hosted revived instrumental post-rock Inverness legends Shutter too. Inverness band The Joshua Hotel there on Saturday saw a packed-out tent for Josh Mackenzie’s three-piece. One of their early sets of last year – third gig! – was in The Seedlings, a showcase of a set of indie-electro-pop songs that already stood out from the crowd. As the singer, guitarist and keyboard-player had revealed in an interview before Belladrum, he was sure they would feel more relaxed for this one and ‘refined’. That came across, his own playfulness coming through in Queer Holiday, casually pushing his keyboard to the ground. New single Don’t You Remember was the song of the set, though inviting on guest singer Shanine Gallagher added a new dimension. A first-time visitor from California made her way to the Hootananny Trailer Trash stage on Saturday lunchtime. Louise Goffin – daughter of famous American songwriters Carole King and Gerry Goffin – showed off her own talents in front of a packed audience there. Sophisticated multi-instrument backing tracks AND the sound of in-demand master guitarist Isaac Sutherland enriched songs including love warning Some Of Them Will Fool You and a song creating American pictures in your mind, Main Street Parade – “Big balloons soaring by, floating down the lane …” Kiefer Sutherland – my Hollywood wildcard – singing authentic country/Americana in Grassroots with musicians to die for might have been a little disappointing from incredibly high expectations. But you’d still love to see him in the sweaty little venues he feels are his natural habitat for a close-up on his performing songs like his own song, the title track of latest album Bloor Street. Favourite cartoon moments? Mine? A tie between The Hootananny Trailer Trash truck with Wile E Coyote and Road Runner and the bestselling Beano-Belladrum collaboration T-shirt. Belladrum 2023 – how was it for you? After the challenges, event producer Dougie Brown was upbeat on Sunday: \"Aside from the traffic issues on Thursday, I think this festival is one of the best – if not the best – one yet!\" Next year will be the 20th anniversary – which artists will everyone wishlist into life for that momentous occasion? The debate over what is going to work for the traffic in future may continue, the bedding in of the Hot House layout will go on, the legend of developing and supporting this annual miracle of logistics and a pulling together of what organisers plan to be the best in music and entertainment to brighten these testing times, has already begun for next year. But that was 2023. Do you want to respond to this article? If so, click here to submit your thoughts and they may be published in print.",

      "title": "Jim&#039;s Gems: Best albums of 1983 - including REM, Waterboys, Violent Femmes...",
      "text": "All new music seemed to be morphing into this bland white funk, spearheaded by certain major artists who should have known better. This led many music fans, me included, to look back to the 1960s and ‘70s. However, there were still some gems to be found and I’ve attempted to pick what I consider to be the best 10. 1. REM, Murmur In my desperate quest for new music, the first port of call was always Dave Fanning. He had begun to champion this little-known band from Athens Georgia, and every night I started to hear songs like ‘Talk About The Passion’, ‘Sitting Still’ and ‘Shaking Through’. As a Byrds fan, REM’s jangly Rickenbacker guitars sounded great, and their subtle mix of punk and Americana ticked all the right boxes. When the album came out I had to travel to Dublin to buy it as we were still awaiting the arrival of a decent record shop here in Cork. However, it was money well spent and the album remains in my opinion one of the finest debut albums ever. 2. Echo And The Bunnymen, Porcupine On this, the Liverpool band’s third album, we see the Bunnymen going for a bigger production and expanding their sound to include strings and woodwind. The initial recording sessions were difficult as the band weren’t getting on but they put their differences behind them and came up with their best-selling album to date which also featured their first two major chart hits, ‘The Back Of Love’ and ‘The Cutter’. The album also featured the iconic cover shot of the band in the snow in Iceland. It was an image that would be forever associated with them and it did wonders for the sale of second-hand overcoats. It was onstage where the songs really came alive. The ensuing tour touched down here in the Savoy in March of that year. 3. Violent Femmes, Violent Femmes While I’m never sure what the term Southern Gothic actually means, it always sums up The Violent Femmes for me. A three-piece from Milwaukee fronted by the enigmatic son of a preacher man, Gordon Gano, their music was a mixture of punk, skiffle, bluegrass, country, and whatever else you’re having. Lyrically, they weren’t afraid to tackle subjects like sex, murder, religion, and infanticide. Often in the same song. This didn’t always go down too well in the bible belt. This album is very basic in comparison to the others, relying on just the three core members and their amazing musicianship. That would change on later records. ‘Blister In The Sun’ and ‘Gone Daddy Gone’ are now recognised anthems which I’ve even played at many weddings over the years. 4. The Waterboys, The Waterboys The Waterboys began in the early 1980s as a duo. While more members may have passed through their ranks over the years than Chelsea have had managers, their debut features mainly Mike Scott with a bit of Anto Thistletwaite, augmented by occasional drummers, bass players, and a drum machine. While they were still searching for the big music there were certainly plenty of hints on this record at the direction they would head. ‘It Should Have Been You’ and ‘Three-Day Man’ have those ’80s anthemic undertones so beloved of U2 and Simple Minds. Thankfully, folk music intervened and saved us. Only the piano-driven ‘A Girl Called Johnny’ features in their current show, but this is an essential part of the Waterboys’ jigsaw, and it more than holds its own alongside what was to follow. 5. The Stranglers, Feline When I played in Cork band Belsonic Sound, we wanted to be The Stranglers. While that was never realistically an option one can dream. Lead singer Finny and I used to walk the city streets at night armed with a Sony Walkman, double adaptor, and The Stranglers on both sets of headphones. We were mega-excited when this album came out as it heralded a new direction for the band. They had developed a much more mellow nocturnal sound with a very European feel. Acoustic bass, acoustic guitars, and electronic drums now prevailed, giving Dave Greenfield loads of space to weave his magic on the keyboards. Perfect sounds for those dark side streets of Cork. ‘Never Say Goodbye’, which closes the record, was the highlight of singer Hugh Cornwell’s recent show at the Live at St Luke's venue. 6. Elvis Costello And The Attractions, Punch The Clock I was in college in Dublin when this came out and it would have gone under my radar but for one of my lecturers who kindly taped it for me. It was the only cassette I had for nearly two weeks so I had no choice but listen to it. This was Costello’s attempt to make a pop record and a lot of his fans weren’t very receptive. While it’s a poppier version of Costello, to my ears at least, the record still sounds ears exactly like him. The album opens with a bang with Let Them All Talk, featuring Dexys’ recognisable horn section. The singles ‘Pills And Soap’ and ‘Everyday I Write The Book’ are textbook quirky Costello. However, it’s the closing track ‘Shipbuilding’, a haunting melancholic piece written about the Falklands War - featuring the legendary Chet Baker on trumpet - that really steals the show. In my opinion, it’s the best song he’s ever written. 7. Bob Dylan, Infidels In 1983 Dylan emerged with arguably his strongest set of songs since Blood On The Tracks and a band which included Sly & Robbie, Mick Taylor, and Mark Knopfler. This was his first secular album since recently emerging from his Born Again Christian period, which had alienated a sizeable chunk of his fans. The single ‘Jokerman’, full of biblical imagery, was probably his most analysed song ever, as his many fanatical followers attempted to decipher his new message for the world. The songs on the album dealt mostly with loss and loneliness. The only qualm many would have with an otherwise excellent record was the inexplicable exclusion of ‘Blind Willie McTell’, regarded by many as one of his best-ever songs. It was recorded as part of Infidels, but wasn’t officially released until 1991, as part of The Bootleg Sessions. 8. Pink Floyd, The Final Cut The Wall in 1989 was probably the most significant and deeply personal piece of art Roger Waters ever produced. It deals with his mainly with his childhood and the trauma of losing his father who was killed in the battle of Anzio in 1944. The album sold millions and there was even a movie but the stress surrounding it took its toll on everyone involved. Richard Wright was fired from the band and Waters was barely on speaking terms with the other two. However, there was unfinished business and the band convened one more time in the studio as a three-piece to complete the journey that was started with The Wall. The Final Cut is the conclusion of a deeply personal and sometimes intense journey that is again inspired by his father’s death while also having a more general anti-war message inspired by events in the Falklands. Waters basically disappears down the rabbit hole on this one, with scant contributions from David Gilmour and Nick Mason, who didn’t really grasp the magnitude of what he was trying to achieve. It would be their final record together. 9. Charlie Haden, Ballad Of The Fallen While many will run for the hills at the mere mention of the words ‘free jazz’, for others it’s the ultimate form of musical expression. Free jazz stalwarts Charlie Haden, Carla Bley, and Don Cherry first got together as the Liberation Music Orchestra in 1970 to record a protest record against the war in Vietnam. They reunited in 1983 and this time their target was the Reagan administration and the government’s various dodgy shenanigans in Central and South America. The resulting record is almost like a symphonic fusion of free jazz, south American sounds, and sometimes traditional American folk music. While that description may invoke horror in many readers, please don’t be put off. I would encourage any curious music lovers who want their ears challenged to give this one a listen. 10. David Bowie, Ziggy Stardust The Motion Picture OST This one is a bit of a wild card because it was actually recorded in 1973 but not officially released until 1983 so I’m including it. This is when Bowie famously killed off Ziggy on the final date of the Aladdin Sane tour in the Hammersmith Odeon. It’s probably the best recording of Ziggy and The Spiders, who are absolutely on fire on the record. It is also one of the best live albums ever. This was the holy grail of bootlegs (a must for any self-respecting music fan in the ’70s and ‘80s) before its official release, and I still have my cassette copy at home somewhere. Of course, we all know he didn’t really kill off Ziggy. He kept coming back. Two that nearly made it Soft Cell, The Art Of Falling Apart: The second album owed more to Vaudeville than to Soho and wasn’t as striking, but it still impresses. David Bowie, Let's Dance: For some his greatest album but for many - myself included - the start of a deep artistic decline, from which it took him years to recover. Do you have an addition to the list - a shocking oversight, or a hidden gem, perhaps? Let us know here: Feedback from Jim Comet's choices for 1973 Eoin O’Kelly: No place for Catch A Fire [Bob Marley and the Wailers]? Ah, now. Tubular Bells is hard to leave out too (though I have to admit it’s years since I’ve listened to it). David Lacey, Wexford: Some fine picks there. Other honorable mentions - King Crimson - Larks' Tongues in Aspic; Can - Future Days; Roxy Music - For Your Pleasure; Led Zeppelin - Houses of the Holy; Neil Young - Time Fades Away; Herbie Hancock - Head Hunters; New York Dolls - New York Dolls; Lynyrd Skynyrd - Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd; Rory Gallagher - Tattoo. Pat Hoban, Kilkenny: In an era when there was so much dreadful prog-rock and endless head-nodding guitar solos (thankfully, punk was just around the corner), I'd concur with most of his selection, although Springsteen fans will feel left out. Yes to the Tom Waits which has endured, and Jim is correct in saying that Berlin is Lou Reed's best offering. Two more I might add are the jazz and funk-influenced Countdown to Ecstasy by Steely Dan, produced by the legendary Gary Katz; and Little Feat's third offering, Dixie Chicken, produced by the great Lowell George.",

      "text": "Is low-quality content dragging down your website’s “reputation of knowledge“? It could be. Could older or outdated content be to blame? Maybe. But low-quality content isn’t defined as “the date it was published.” Nothing is that simple – there are many other factors at play. Google repeatedly emphasized this after CNET deleted thousands of old pages. Pruning content for SEO in bulk isn’t a magic fix that guarantees a rankings boost for all the remaining pages. Older content on your website shouldn’t harm your SEO performance as long as it’s of good quality. Look no further than The New York Times. Read on to find out how to assess the quality of your content from an SEO perspective and how to decide whether you should improve or remove that content. What is quality content? Quality content comprehensively answers questions, solves problems or otherwise satisfies the group of people Avinash Kaushik would call your “largest addressable qualified audience,” in his See/Think/Do/Care model. Other attributes of quality content: Accurate (i.e., trustworthy) Easy to consume Educational Entertaining Helpful Informative Inspiring Optimized Original Shareable Useful Not every piece of content will have all of these attributes. But great content should incorporate as many of these attributes as possible. Google has also provided insights into what it considers quality content in Creating helpful, reliable, people-first content. It provides specific questions you should ask yourself when self-assessing the quality of your content: Does the content provide original information, reporting, research, or analysis? Does the content provide a substantial, complete, or comprehensive description of the topic? Does the content provide insightful analysis or interesting information that is beyond the obvious? If the content draws on other sources, does it avoid simply copying or rewriting those sources, and instead provide substantial additional value and originality? Does the main heading or page title provide a descriptive, helpful summary of the content? Does the main heading or page title avoid exaggerating or being shocking in nature? Is this the sort of page you’d want to bookmark, share with a friend, or recommend? Would you expect to see this content in or referenced by a printed magazine, encyclopedia, or book? Does the content provide substantial value when compared to other pages in search results? Does the content have any spelling or stylistic issues? Is the content produced well, or does it appear sloppy or hastily produced? Is the content mass-produced by or outsourced to a large number of creators, or spread across a large network of sites, so that individual pages or sites don’t get as much attention or care? Also, you should be familiar with E-E-A-T and have read Google’s Search Quality Rater Guidelines PDF. Dig deeper: What is quality content Define your key content metrics All of these attributes are nice in theory. But how do you turn the concept of “quality content” into something you can measure? Here are five possible ways to measure “quality”: Pageviews: Traffic can be a great indicator of success – the more reads, the better. Organic traffic: Rankings have never been as important to me as actual organic traffic (people on my website). I don’t care if I rank in Position 1 for a term that drives little or no relevant/valuable traffic to my site. Links: Look at internal links and links to your content from external sites. Quality matters more than quantity (e.g., one link from a relevant, quality site may be better than 100 links from 100 bad/mediocre domains). Evaluate the value of all your links. Conversions: What matters for you? Newsletter signups? Subscriptions? Sales? Revenue? Your content should be a part of the buyer’s journey, contributing to business goals and the SEO strategy. Engagement: If you value longer time-on-site, that could be one form of engagement to factor in your assessment. Or maybe it’s scroll depth. The point here is you’re looking for something beyond just “traffic” – as traffic alone is meaningless without some other form of engagement. Tailor your metrics to your unique situation. Getting started: Content elements to examine What content do you have? Do a content audit to find out. This process will help you evaluate whether your content needs to be updated or removed. Create a spreadsheet with information about your content for some directional guidance. This is what I’ve found to be most useful to me (you may want to include more or other elements): Title: Is it accurate? Could it be better optimized? Does it have a clear reader benefit? URL: Is it SEO friendly? Does it need to change (e.g., does the URL contain a year)? Author: Did a subject matter expert or authority write it? Does the person who wrote it still work with/for your company (or do you still have a relationship)? Are you able to contact the writer? Publication date: This is more important to know for content types that can/should be updated (i.e., not news). Pageviews (historic vs. recent): What I’m looking for here is the worst-performing content or any content that used to get lots of traffic but no longer does. Word count: Lower word counts could be an indicator of quality issues. Links: Has your content earned links from other sites? How many internal links have you built to the content? Trust Flow and Citation Flow: These Majestic metrics can indicate link quality and equity. Higher scores are better. A couple of quick points about word count: Google has said word count doesn’t matter for SEO and I believe there is no best/perfect word count for SEO. At this stage, I’m looking for symptoms of low quality – word count could indicate issues, though it won’t always be the cause. As with everything, you need to investigate further. Next comes the hard part: reviewing your content and determining what action to take. This part will require human judgment calls from the people who are experts in the subject matter and those who understand SEO. And remember: many variables influence the success of your content. Circling back to the key metrics, I typically evaluate whether to improve or remove content based on whether it is: SEO positive: These are your unicorns/rock stars – they are helping you achieve goals. SEO neutral: Some content just exists – neither helping nor hurting. This type of content is basically useless. SEO negative: Thin, outdated and unhelpful content – anything that can negatively impact your performance. Content to leave alone Before we discuss improving or removing content, we have to talk about a special type of content that needs no changes. There is a rare form of content that needs no changes (for now) because it: Is thoroughly helpful – all the information is accurate and up to date, or it has historical value. Consistently gets good traffic and engagement. Has attracted many quality links. Ranks in Position 1-3. Generates conversions. Leave it alone. (For now.) Once you’ve earned Position 1 in the organic search results, where will you go? Not up. No major changes are needed. Just make sure to do routine maintenance on it. Focus your efforts on all the other content that isn’t in this position. Get the daily newsletter search marketers rely on. Why you should improve content In more recent years, Google has advised against removing content and suggested making \"thin\" content \"thick\" (i.e., better) while also adding more high-quality content. \"...don't remove content someone might find useful,\" according to Google's Gary Illyes. Likewise, Mueller said \"improving it is probably the best thing to do in general\" \"...if you can improve your content that's probably the best approach possible because then you have something really useful on your website you're providing something useful for the web in general.\" How to improve content Improving content is more about making a few quick changes and updating your publication date. You need to assess every detail of your content – and compare it against the content ranking from your competitors. That includes: Alignment with audience/search/user intent. Call to action. Clarity. Data. Depth. Facts. Formatting. Grammar and spelling. Links/citations. Missing information. Multimedia (videos, images, audio). Readability. Structure. Title. Tone of voice / writing style. URL Usefulness. Value. Update An update typically requires the least amount of time investment. At most, about 20-25% of the content needs to be changed. Your content needs to be rewritten if the following apply: Traffic (or rankings) declines, especially near a Google core update. Attracting fewer/no links. Engagement is decreasing. It ranks in the top 5-10 and going higher is realistic by putting in the needed work. Conversions are declining. Rewrite This is the more extreme form of content update – where up to 100% of the content needs to be written. Your content needs to be rewritten if: It currently gets little or no traffic. It no longer attracts new links. Engagement is bad or non-existent. It doesn’t rank in top 10. It's no longer indexed. It's not driving any conversions. Sometimes, you have a piece of content on a useful, relevant or helpful topic, but it was just written poorly. To address that, make sure to: Start content from scratch. Update information so it is accurate. 301 redirect old to new post on a new (optimized) URL. Google can forward full PageRank through 301 redirects. However, you get the most value when the new page is as close to a 1:1 match with the topic of the old page. Consolidate and redirect Here are the reasons why you might want to consider consolidating your content: You have multiple articles on one topic. One page gets an insignificant amount of traffic; others get even less or none. None of the articles attract any new links or get any engagement. The article is not ranking in the top 10 positions, or… The wrong page ranks. Two pages are competing on the same SERP. Combining content when needed gets the approval of Google’s John Mueller. He said of the topic: “Probably. I think that’s something that generally… we see if you take two or three or four kind of weaker pages and merge them into one, even within the same site or externally, then that’s something where we can say that this is a stronger page. We can see that… more parts of the site are referring to this one single piece of content so it’s probably more relevant than those individual small pieces that you had before.“ Here's how to do it: Create one awesome and helpful piece of content. Start from scratch, writing on the topic from today's perspective, but reuse/repurpose any existing relevant content. Make it better than your competitors. 301 redirect to new (optimized) URL. Why you should remove content Low-quality content is bad for users. And what's bad for users is bad for SEO. After Google launched Panda, we learned from Google that content pruning could help rankings for higher-quality content emphasis mine): “In addition, it’s important for webmasters to know that low quality content on part of a site can impact a site’s ranking as a whole. For this reason, if you believe you’ve been impacted by this change you should evaluate all the content on your site and do your best to improve the overall quality of the pages on your domain. Removing low quality pages or moving them to a different domain could help your rankings for the higher quality content.” Note the emphasis here is on low-quality content, not old content. That said, old content typically tends to be lower quality. Things break (links, images) and information changes. While Panda has long been incorporated into Google's core algorithm, Google's newer helpful content system is a sitewide algorithm, meaning that \"if Google determines your site is producing a relatively high amount of unhelpful content, primarily written for ranking in search, then your whole site will be impacted.\" Google told us that “removing unhelpful content could help the rankings of your other content.” Same advice, different algorithms. Just replace \"low-quality\" with \"unhelpful\". Let's make it simple. Just ask yourself a simple question: Am I embarrassed by the content on this page? Here are four ways you can go about answering that question for your content: Is your content relevant to your target audience? In the chase for revenue and growth, be careful not to lose sight of your core audience in favor of publishing content about anything and everything. Stay true to your identity and your audience. Is your content helping achieve a goal? This will tie back to your key metrics (e.g., is the content helping you rank, attracting links, driving conversions). Is your content optimized (for keywords and user intent)? Analyzing Google's SERPs will give you critical insights into specific keywords you're targeting, such as what content is ranking and what searchers want or need from your content. Is your content unsuccessful? Go back to how Google and this article have defined quality (plus your own unbiased judgment). Does it meet your quality standards? Look at your key metrics, whether that's traffic, engagement, links, conversions, shares or something else. What else could negatively impact you? Google has told us via the Search Quality Rater Guidelines: E-E-A-T is inadequate. Main content quality is low. Amount of main content is unsatisfying. Title is exaggerated or shocking (a.k.a., clickbait). Ads or supporting content distracts from the main content. Information about the website or content creator is unsatisfying. The website or content creator has a mildly negative reputation. Types of content to consider culling: Thin content. This is often a vague term. I've historically defined \"thin\" content as content that is: Poorly written. Anything riddled with spelling and grammatical issues. Or it may just feel generally incomplete or thoroughly unsatisfying because it doesn't deliver on its promise or answer your question. Off-topic. You can publish content about any topic you want, but you should focus your resources on the most relevant topics and subtopics and any adjacent topics that make sense for your brand or business. Syndicated. Stolen/plagiarized. No historical significance. If you published content about an event, person, idea, or some other thing that is no longer important – especially if it failed to gain any long-term traction. This is very much a judgment call. You know your audience best. Very low number of pageviews in the past year. Anything with zero pageviews should be looked at first. From there, it's a judgment call – you have to determine what level of traffic makes a page worthy of retaining. Bottom line: Will anybody miss the content if it's gone? If your answer is no, it's time to remove it. This flowchart may be helpful: How to remove content If the content can't be updated in any of the above ways, it's time to decide whether to remove it – either blocking it from search engines or deleting it from your site. Block it In cases where you want to keep the content on your site, but not have it appear in search results, blocking the URL is probably your best bet. You can do that by adding the noindex meta tag. One other alternative is to require a password to view the content. Delete it Remove it from your site. It doesn't matter to Google whether that page has a 410 or 404 status, Mueller said in a 2018 Webmaster Hangout: “From our point of view, in the mid term/long term, a 404 is the same as a 410 for us. So in both of these cases, we drop those URLs from our index. We generally reduce crawling a little bit of those URLs so that we don’t spend too much time crawling things that we know don’t exist. The subtle difference here is that a 410 will sometimes fall out a little bit faster than a 404. But usually, we’re talking on the order of a couple days or so. So if you’re just removing content naturally, then that’s perfectly fine to use either one. If you’ve already removed this content long ago, then it’s already not indexed so it doesn’t matter for us if you use a 404 or 410.” Keep 'building out your reputation of knowledge' Improving, removing and consolidating content is good SEO. It's hard work – and it's not quick. Done right, it's absolutely worth it in the long term. Source: searchengineland.com",

      "title": "How Many Episodes Are There &#038; Where Should New Fans Really Begin?",
      "text": "While the best option for starting “One Piece” is to simply start at the beginning, there are a few tricks that new fans can use to sidestep the show’s long runtime. One possible solution is to start reading the “One Piece” manga since most viewers will be able to soar through Eiichiro Oda’s comic panels faster than the show presents those events. Fans who begin with the manga can then switch over to the “One Piece” anime at any point they choose, though admittedly, this solution forces you to miss out on the colorful animation style and electric fight scenes that help make the anime so popular. A more prudent solution would be to follow one of the many fan-assembled anime filler lists across the internet, which denote which episodes are actually required viewing and which episodes have no impact on the story. This will help you skip dozens of episodes and save hours of viewing time, though you will still have to commit a hefty chunk of time to catch up. Finally, fans could simply begin at one of the more “recent” arcs like the Dressrosa or Wano arcs, both of which are still incredibly long but which will save you several hundred episodes of viewing. New viewers can then use one of the many fan-made recap videos online to catch up to whatever arc they feel like starting at, or even read the summaries of each arc on the One Piece Wiki.",

      "title": "Top 10 Interesting Facts Involving Very Large Numbers",
      "text": "This list shows off some of the incredibly large numbers involved in life and the universe that you might not be aware of. Ever wondered if there are more sand grains than insects on Earth? What about how many seconds have roughly passed since the Big Bang? Which amazing fact produces the biggest number? Math might not be everyone’s favorite subject, but the truth is numbers are everywhere, from how many cups of coffee you drink to how much weight you bench in the gym or even how much you were ripped off when you bought your new car. But there are some facts out there to do with numbers so fascinating that even people who detest math would be interested. Specifically, facts that involve truly gigantic numbers. Here is the list of the top 10 interesting facts involving very large numbers. Related: Top 10 Superstitious Beliefs Involving Numbers 10 Your Billionth Second of Life Around half the people on the planet have never known the joy of celebrating their billionth second of life. Math has proven that your billionth second is about halfway between your 31st and 32nd birthdays. For some people, this is not a massive deal, but to others, it is quite a milestone and achievement to brag that you are one billion seconds old. It makes you sound very wise. To figure this out, you just need to do some simple math. There are 86,400 seconds in one day, which you can calculate pretty easily on your phone. Divide one billion by 86,400, and you get 11,574 which gives you the number of days one billion seconds makes up. Divide that number by 365 (the number of days in a year), and you get approximately 31.7 years. So get the date marked down in your calendar because you only turn one billion (seconds) once![1] 9 Trees on Earth vs. Stars in Our Galaxy Millions of people love the experience of walking through a forest full of trees, but have you ever wondered how many trees there are on Earth? The number might blow you away! As of 2023, there are over three trillion trees on Earth! That is a mighty jump from the number of humans on the planet, which is just over eight billion at the time of writing. Doing the math of three trillion divided by eight billion means that for every human alive, there would be 375 trees! Not only that, but there are more trees on Earth than stars in our Milky Way galaxy, with at least 100 billion stars! That means that if you wanted to have the same number of stars in our galaxy as trees on Earth, then you would have to multiply all the stars in the galaxy by 30.[2] 8 Insects vs. Sand Humans see themselves as the dominant species of the planet, but that definitely isn’t because of our quantity. For every human alive on Earth, there are about 1.4 billion insects, so if you do the math, then there are approximately 11.2 quintillion insects on the planet! That’s an 11 with 18 digits next to it. But what about sand? Are there more than 11.2 quintillion grains of sand on Earth? As it turns out, yes. Much more! The number of grains of sand on Earth is approximately seven sextillion, which is much more than the number of insects on the planet. Imagine a 7 with 21 zeros next to it. To put this number into perspective, if you do the math of 7 sextillions divided by 11.2 quintillions, you will get 625 which is the number of sand grains for every insect on Earth![3] 7 Seconds since the Big Bang Ever wanted to know how old the universe was to the second? Well, these experts were able to pull it off, and we now know how many seconds have passed since the Big Bang… roughly. If the Big Bang theory is true, then the Big Bang is estimated to have occurred 13.8 billion years ago, making our universe 13.8 billion years old. After doing some complicated math, experts were able to calculate the answer of 436 quadrillion, or 436,117,076,600,000,000 seconds since the Big Bang, to be more precise. Obviously, they cannot get this down to the exact second; otherwise, I would have to keep editing this article every second of the day. But this is still an amazing thing to know. This is a big number. However, 436 quadrillion is not bigger than the number of insects on Earth and is certainly not bigger than the number of sand grains on Earth, as I previously discussed. This is surprising since we are talking about the number of seconds since the Big Bang! But as you will see, the numbers will only get bigger from here.[4] 6 Stars in the Universe I previously talked about how many stars are in the Milky Way galaxy. That number was big, but the number of galaxies in the observable universe is said to be more than 200 billion, so the number of stars that are in the universe is enormous! The number of stars in the observable universe is approximately 1024, or one septillion, which is a 1 followed by 24 zeros (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000). Just to put it in perspective how much bigger the number of stars in the universe is compared to the number of seconds since the Big Bang, let’s do some quick math. If we calculate one septillion minus 436 quadrillion (the number of seconds since the Big Bang), that will equal 999 sextillion, or 999,999,563,882,923,400,000,000, to be exact. This tells us how many seconds are still needed to match the number of stars in the universe. Now, let’s divide that by 60 to turn the seconds into minutes, then divide by 60 again to turn the minutes into hours, then divide by 24 to turn the hours into days, and finish by dividing by 365 to turn the days into years. Finally, we are left with 31 quadrillion years, or 31,709,778,154,582,806 years, until the number of seconds since the Big Bang matches the number of stars in the universe. Simply put, we have a long time to wait until that happens. [5] 5 Atoms in One Human Did you know there are more atoms in one human being than there are stars in the observable universe! The number of stars in the universe is estimated to be one septillion, as mentioned before. But the number of atoms in one human body is estimated to be about 1027, or one octillion. Just imagine a 1 with 27 zeros next to it! To put this number into perspective, the number of cells alone in one human is estimated to be about 30 or 40 trillion, so if we took every human on Earth, which is eight billion people, and multiplied it by 40 trillion, then potentially, depending on if everyone does have 40 trillion cells in them, there are 3.2 x 10 23, or 320 sextillion human cells on Earth, which is nothing compared to one octillion atoms in one person![6] 4 Number of Bacteria on Earth Bacteria are everywhere—your gut, your mouth, your toilet seat, your phone. Almost everything you come across in everyday life has bacteria living on it. It’s astonishing to know that we were not always what we are today and came from bacteria-like organisms, but did you know just how many bacteria are on Earth today? Prepare yourself because it is a lot! The number of bacteria on Earth is approximately 5 x 1030, or a 5 with 30 zeros next to it. It’s called five nonillion, and it is truly a number to be afraid of. This number is larger than the number of atoms in your body considerably. In fact, it is 5,000 times larger! Bacteria are the oldest organisms that we have ever known, and the sheer amount of them is just astounding, especially when you realize how unaware you are of these microscopic creatures on a daily basis. You might not be able to see them, but they really are everywhere around you as you read this.[7] 3 Card Deck Number There are 52 cards in an ordinary card deck. Obviously, when you shuffle them, you are trying to randomize the order. But did you know that the number of possible arrangements you can get from scrambling up a 52-card deck is so large that it even makes the number of bacteria on Earth look like zero in comparison! That number is 52! No, I’m not saying that angrily. Actually, 52 with an exclamation mark next to it means 52 factorial in math, which means we calculate 52 x 51 x 50 x 49… all the way down to 1. Every time we multiply the number like this, we produce a bigger, scarier result, and the final answer to this crazy sum is 8 x 1067 or 80 unvigintillion. Basically, imagine an 8 with 67 zeros next to it. That gives you the number of possible combinations you can get whenever you shuffle a 52-playing card deck. This number is so unbelievably large that the configuration you get after shuffling a card deck will never have been previously seen by anyone in history and will never be seen again by anyone ever. If we were to try to go through every possible combination, one decillion people would have to shuffle a card deck each once every millisecond for 2.5 septillion years, or 2,557,653,956,460,676,007,472,749 years, to be precise. I think it’s appropriate to assume that humans as a species will not live to last 2.5 septillion years. And there will never be one decillion people to have ever lived, so we will never see every card combination, unfortunately. [8] 2 Atoms in the Universe vs. Chess As you would probably expect, the number of atoms in the entire universe is pretty large. The number is approximately between 1078 and 1082. Just imagine a 1 with about 80 zeros next to it. It’s obvious that the number would be this big since atoms build up everything, from rocks in space to stars to the planets and everything on those planets, but what is truly incredible is that this is nothing when it comes to chess! If you play chess correctly, the number of different ways the pieces can be arranged is about 1040. This is definitely a big number. However, if you allow illegal moves and let the pieces move wherever they want, then the number accelerates all the way up to 10123, or a 1 with 123 zeros next to it! This number is monstrous and bigger than anything I have mentioned so far. To reach this number, you would have to take the number of atoms in the universe, which is roughly 1080, and then multiply it by 10 tredecillion, which is a number that is already monstrously bigger than the number of stars in the universe, seconds since the Big Bang, and atoms in one human combined. After all this, I think there is no other appropriate time to say… Checkmate.[9] 1 Rubik’s Cubes But then we have this. I think a large percentage of people have heard of the massive number of different ways you can arrange a Rubik’s cube. If you don’t know, the answer is there are 43 quintillion ways that you can arrange a Rubik’s cube. That is pretty big, but did you know you can get different-sized Rubik’s cubes with more moving parts? Some of them will make any mathematician hide under their bed! The normal Rubik’s cube is a 3x3x3 cube since it has three cube pieces going along the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis. However, you can purchase 4x4x4 cubes or even 5x5x5 cubes. In fact, you can go all the way up to 12x12x12 if you wish! This is where the number of possible ways to arrange Rubik’s cubes starts skyrocketing at an unfathomable rate. A 7x7x7 Rubik’s cube has 1.9 x 10160 ways to arrange it. Just imagine a 1 with 160 digits following it! This is the biggest number covered in this article; it is bigger than the number of ways to arrange a card deck, the number of atoms in the universe, and the number of possible ways a chess game can play out. In fact, it is bigger than all these numbers combined and then multiplied by 19 undecillion! The largest Rubik’s cube ever invented is a 33x33x33 cube with a total number of ways you can arrange it of 104,094, or a 1 with 4,094 zeros next to it. This number is indescribable; there is virtually nothing I can compare it to for you to understand how utterly ludicrous this number is. I can’t even describe how much bigger it is than the combination of every number mentioned in this article. This is by far the winning fact on the list if the objective was to produce the biggest number.[10] fact checked by Darci Heikkinen",

      "title": "Chapter 2: The Bombshell… – Slugger O'Toole",
      "text": "Continued from Sovereignty 2024: My meeting with Rishi Sunak My second private briefing in Chequers in August 2024 wasn’t all that different from the first. The rumour was that the PM was considering calling the general election for October. He didn’t want to have to reconvene parliament to give Labour a platform to lambaste the Government. Better to get it over with quickly. The public wouldn’t start paying attention until September anyway, and memories of a paltry budget were fading. The economic news wasn’t getting any better though. The economy was flat lining. The hoped for rise in consumer spending was being killed off by huge increases in mortgage repayments. House prices were falling at their fastest pace since the Second World War. Independent economic think tanks kept issuing reports saying that the British public had experienced the greatest drop in their standard of living since that war. Real household disposable income per person had fallen by 6% in the previous two years. Britain’s tax burden, measured as a share of economic output had risen to 38%, the highest it had been since the war, making the Tory claim to be the “low taxation party” somewhat hollow. Wages hadn’t kept pace with inflation, and the cost of living had stayed stubbornly high, despite much higher interest rates. Higher interest rates had also choked off all marginal or risky investments. Businesses were cutting back on all but the safest and most lucrative investment project proposals. Strike activity had still not died down, resulting in a lot of disruption, bitterness, and division in society even after strikes had been ended. Crime rates were at a 20 year record high, and there was increasing lawlessness on the streets. People were cutting back on all but essentials. The numbers in Britain using food banks had increased from 25,000 in 2008 to over 3 million in 2023. Over four million children were living in poverty. Over 270,000 people were officially classed as homeless, including 123,000 children. Seven and a half million people were on hospital waiting lists for routine treatments and of these 400,000 had been waiting for more than a year, the highest figures since records began. I was fascinated to see how the PM would propose to address all these challenges. Of the five pledges Sunak had made on gaining the top job, he had failed to deliver on three – Growing the Economy, Reducing Debt and Reducing Waiting Lists. Progress had only been fitful on the other two – Halving Inflation and Reducing Illegal Immigration. Blaming the doctors and nurses strikes for the increased waiting lists wasn’t get much traction with the public. It was getting harder and harder to find some good news to sell to the electorate. The briefing started with the PM in ebullient form listing countless initiatives the government was taking in all areas of public life. It seemed like one long list and certainly gave the impression of an energetic, focused, and determined government. But as reporters started digging into the details, they realised that many of the actions listed were repeats of earlier promises that had not been delivered and many had paltry budgets allocated to them. A few extra million here and there weren’t going to go far to address many of the problems itemised on the list. There was lots of talk of public private partnerships, of the government working in close collaboration with charities, but little clarity as to why most businesses – many struggling to keep afloat – should suddenly become social service providers as well. The briefing got more and more contentious as time went on with reporters getting increasingly querulous. Having almost gotten burned at my first briefing, I stayed well out of it, feeling that other reporters were addressing all the important issues and were more clued in on the details. They had been following these issues for years. Almost by the way, towards the end of the allocated time, the PM mentioned he had an announcement to make in relation to Northern Ireland. The Northern Secretary of State had, after due consideration and careful analysis of all the evidence, come to the view that there was an increasing likelihood that a border poll would result in a vote for a united Ireland. Accordingly, in accordance with the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, he had decided to call a border poll to be held no later that 12 months from the date of this announcement. There was a collective intake of breadth in the room, but no one said anything. People seemed dumbfounded. There being no specialist Ireland reporters in the room, I felt I had to ask a question: “Could the prime minister clarify, what new evidence had led the Northern Secretary to come this conclusion? After all it was almost 16 months since the last elections in May 2023 – the local elections in Northern Ireland – and while opinion polls since had shown increased support for Sinn Féin, there was no evidence that this would translate into a majority for a united Ireland.” “I’m glad you asked me that”, he smiled, almost as if he had planted that question with me himself. “The Secretary of State will issue a detailed statement later outlining the factors he has taken into account, which I understand include the trend in recent elections, opinion poll data, the census results, reduced popular support for the current devolved government arrangements in Northern Ireland, and some focus group research his department have been carrying out. It is important that we respect the democratic process in Northern Ireland and honour our international obligations under the Good Friday Agreement”. The prime Minster then moved the discussion on to his new Industrial Strategy – which included tax breaks, state aids, grants for productivity improvements and worker re-training – before I could ask any follow up questions. Towards the end of the briefing, I tried to raise the issue of whether the Irish government had been consulted on the decision to hold a border poll. The PM stated that “according to the Good Friday Agreement, it is the Northern Secretary, and the Northern Secretary alone who must come to a determination as to whether a border poll is likely to be carried. The Irish government has been informed and the Northern Secretary will issue a more detailed statement later”. Next question please – and he pointedly didn’t point to me. All further questions on the topic by other reporters were re-directed to the Northern Secretary and the PM closed the meeting after answering a few desultory questions on other topics. The briefing adjourned and some of the other reporters, those who knew of my previous assignment in Ireland, bombarded me with questions as to what this meant for Ireland and, in particular, for Northern Ireland. A scrum gradually formed around me as other reporters – not very well up on Ireland or Northern Ireland – became anxious to catch up with the conversation. The Press secretary had to hoosh us all out of the room saying it was needed for another important meeting. Outside the building, and trying to be helpful, I said that I imagined the Irish government would be upset as they hadn’t asked for a border poll and probably didn’t want this distraction in the middle of the run up to their own general election, expected to take place in November. Sinn Féin would be delighted, however, I thought. They had been calling for a border poll for a long time and would love to fight the upcoming general election on that issue. As far as Northern Ireland was concerned, I felt sure the decision would be welcomed in most nationalist circles as “clearing the air” after two and a half years of stalemate on devolution and that there was a feeling that Northern Ireland had to find some other way forward. However, I doubted the decision would be welcomed in most unionist circles as it was likely to be a very divisive and perhaps corrosive campaign. I suggested that unionism had reconciled itself to Direct Rule as preferable to a Sinn Féin First Minister led Executive and were happy not to have to take responsibility for all the huge public service budget cuts the Secretary of State had been imposing. The Alliance Party would be sure to regard the timing as “unhelpful” I felt, although we must wait and see what the parties actually said. Early reports of the briefing in all the media were dominated by the Northern Ireland announcement with little reference to all the other policy announcements made by the PM. In fact, because reporters couldn’t mention him by name – other than as a “senior government source“ – most of the reports actually named me and quoted my comments on the announcement. They did so without noting my qualification that “we must wait and see what the parties actually say” and gave the impression that I, a junior reporter from the Tribune, was in a position to authoritatively report on the reactions of all the parties. Stupidly I had forgotten that the “no attribution rule” only applied to the PM. There was nothing to stop anyone naming me, especially as I had also been speaking outside the building and outside the immediate context of the briefing. One newspaper actual led with the headline: “Jeremy Watson says border poll campaign will be divisive and corrosive”. Who? It was only some way down the piece that the reader learned that the Jeremy Watson quoted was “the Ireland Correspondent for the Tribune”. It didn’t mention I had since been replaced in that role. I had to apologise to my successor. The situation was exacerbated by the fact that there had been no reaction from the Irish government or the Northern Ireland parties to date, and thus my opinions were all that the non-Ireland specialist reporters had to go on and were thus featured prominently in their reports. It later emerged that the Secretary of State was actually in Dublin informing the Irish government of his decision at that very moment, and that Northern Ireland parties were also only just being informed by a junior Northern Ireland Office Minister. When I got back to the office, the news was all over the place. Those staff who actually knew me gave me the thumbs up, although some seemed to have a concerned look on their faces. I found that my more senior colleagues were less than impressed by my sudden rise to media fame. Some asked, rather sarcastically, whether I was now the spokesperson for the Irish government, Sinn Fein, and all the Northern Ireland parties combined. The Tribune’s senior foreign correspondent was particularly miffed. “I understand that, in your considered opinion, the Prime Minister should not have used his absolute discretion to call a border poll under the terms of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement?” he said, in a rather exaggerated formal posh accent. I apologised for having inadvertently strayed onto his patch. I didn’t even dare correct him that it was actually the Secretary of State who was empowered by the Good Friday Agreement to make that decision. More ominously, my editor said nothing, other than “could I please confine my report of the briefing to the PM’s actual remarks”. The water cooler gossip was that I had been played by the PM. I didn’t get too many sympathetic looks. Some pity, perhaps. More likely “who does he think he is?” They were not wrong. Official reaction followed swiftly from the Irish government and all the Irish and Northern Irish political parties. Thankfully, my fame (or notoriety) was short-lived. That said, the reactions were much as I had anticipated. The Irish government expressed regret that they had not been consulted or informed beforehand but welcomed the 12 month delay as there needed to be a lot of preparatory work done prior to the vote to ensure all voters knew exactly what they were voting for or against. There was no announcement of an Irish referendum which I presumed would be required to give effect to an all-Ireland government should the border poll be carried. Sinn Féin complained that the government should have been doing all this preparatory work all along, and that they would make it a priority to rectify that as soon as they got into government. It was now imperative that the Irish government call the general election immediately so that the Irish electorate could have their say. Most of the other parties agreed that the timing was unfortunate and that there should have been much more consultation and discussion before any announcement of the Secretary of State’s decision. The Alliance party felt that the announcement was ”unhelpful“ at this difficult time for Northern Ireland and that all communities must band together to avoid their differences being exploited by extremist parties. The Greens noted that any border poll campaign promises should include provision for a more integrated rail network throughout Ireland and that there should be no additional funds for motorways. The DUP complained that this was one more example of the British Government betraying Northern Ireland, and that “the people” must show their disgust by voting for DUP candidates at the forthcoming general election. The time had come for Unionist Unity in the face of this existentialist threat to the Union. The UUP agreed but stated that Unionist Unity did not mean every uniting behind the DUP. The time had come for unionists to spread their message to all the people of Northern Ireland as “we all have a stake in maintaining a peaceful and prosperous union”. “The UUP”, it claimed, “was best placed to unite all those who supported the Union”. All independent analysts expressed their surprise that the Secretary of State should have come to his determination just before the general election – when much more up-to-the-minute hard information on voter preferences would have become available after the election. Some reports suggested that it was actually an attempt to help the DUP get out their vote, and that the quid pro quo might be that the DUP would promise to return to the assembly. That suggestion was quickly quashed when the DUP made it clear that it was pointless even talking about returning to the assembly until the constitutional question had been finally settled. The use of the phrase “finally settled” led some analysts to speculate that a secret deal had been done whereby the UK government would remove the Good Friday Agreement’s provision for repeat referendums (at a minimum of 7 year intervals) if the first referendum result was for a continuance of the Union. They also suggested that unionists had a better chance of winning a border poll sooner rather than later and that, once the issue was settled, the way was clear for an indefinite, long term return to Direct Rule, as devolution had clearly failed with “both sides” guilty of the failure to fully implement the Good Friday agreement. However, it was never explained how a British government could change the terms of the Good Friday Agreement without the agreement of the Irish government, or tie the hands of Northern Ireland Secretaries for the indefinite future. Also, why did the DUP not welcome the announcement if they were so confident of winning the border poll? I began to suspect that another private briefing had taken place on the Border poll announcement that I had not been invited to. All of the media reports seemed to be taking the same line and citing the same “senior government official”. My senior colleagues at the Tribune assured me that no such private briefing had taken place – at least not to their knowledge. It later emerged that a briefing had taken place at the Foreign Office to which some reporters had been invited. Strangely, the Northern Ireland Office had little to say, other than issuing a lengthy formal statement detailing the reasons for the Secretary of States determination that a vote for re-unification was “likely”. It was the first time I had ever seen “focus group research” given as one of the reasons for a formal government decision. In the days following, a number of opinion polls were published showing surprisingly high levels of support for the calling of the border poll in both in Northern Ireland and Britain in response to the question “Should the people of Northern Ireland be given the opportunity to express their views on union with Britain or Ireland?” Well, doh! Who wouldn’t approve of that question when it was put to them like that! Especially independence supporters in Scotland. What intrigued me was how quickly all these opinion polls were published. Normally it takes a couple of weeks to decide to hold a poll, schedule it with the market research agencies, agree a budget, agree the wording of the questions and the scope of the demographics to be included, collate and analyse the results, and publish the findings – usually spread out over a number of days to maximise the publicity the polling agency and the sponsoring media outlets got for the results. The first polls showing widespread support for the government decision appeared in a matter of days following the government announcement. The decision became much less controversial after that. Apparently, government spokespersons were briefing that it was important to see past all the vested interests blocking progress and “let the people decide”. The government, it seemed, had lost patience with the Northern Ireland parties’ failure to implement devolution and a large majority of the public in Britain and Northern Ireland agreed with them. Whether by chance or otherwise I was shortly afterwards “promoted” to the position of the Tribune’s Climate Change correspondent, a new position which the editor said they had been thinking of creating for some time. There would be no more tilting at windmills for me! I wrote a final piece describing the government’s decision as reckless, without due regard to the sensitivities of the situation in Northern Ireland and driven purely by the government’s need to distract public attention away from their appalling economic record. Although the formal decision was couched in lofty terms about the Secretary of State’s duty to perform his function under the Good Friday Agreement “impartially”, having due regard for the evidence of changing attitudes and voting behaviour in Northern Ireland, with due respect for the democratic process, and with Britain having “no selfish strategic interest” with respect to Northern Ireland, the timing and manner of the announcement made it reasonable to assume that other factors were at play. I mentioned that saving £15 Billion on the Northern Ireland subvention could fund a lot of much needed social services in Britain. To my surprise, the editor published my piece, describing it as my best piece yet, and wished me well in my new role. I think I could even detect a smile in his face. Sure enough, and to no one’s surprise, the issue of the £15 Billion subvention soon became a central feature of the debate in England following the announcement of the General election a few weeks later. Analysts noted it was about twice as much as the much-hated net subvention to the EU which Brexiteers has made such play of saving. Labour were wrong-footed. Soon they were being asked to explain where they would find the many Billions they needed to fund their election promises. Everyone knew where the Conservatives were proposing to find the money to fund their promises, although no Conservative spokesperson ever publicly averred it might come from the Northern Ireland subvention. Officially the Tories remained neutral on the Border poll and solemnly declared that they would respect the people’s vote. When challenged that they were supposed to be the Conservative AND Unionist party, conservative spokespersons stressed they were all in favour of the Union, but only insofar as the people of Northern Ireland wanted it. Spokespersons noted a May 2022 statement issued by The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP, Prime Minister, which approvingly quoted the 1990 declaration by the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Brooke, arguing that Britain had “no selfish strategic or economic interest” in Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson had emphasized that that statement did not say “no strategic or economic interest” in Northern Ireland, – but “no selfish strategic or economic interest”. There had been no change in government policy. This was all about letting the people of Northern Ireland have their say. When challenged as to why they weren’t offering a referendum to Scotland, their position was that that matter had been settled by the 2014 independence referendum, and that unlike Northern Ireland there was no internationally binding treaty obliging the UK to hold further referendums in Scotland, even if opinion polls indicated their might, from time to time, be a majority in favour of it. “Opinions polls come and go, but the constitutional settlement is permanent” was the official line. Spokespersons also stressed that, other than in the specific case of the Good Friday Agreement, referendums were only advisory under the UK Constitution, and take place only at the absolute discretion of the government of the day. In their view Britain had had quite enough of referendums in recent times, and they didn’t propose to hold another one any time soon. This seemed to be a popular policy in England if the opinion polls were in any way accurate. During the course of the subsequent election campaign, English voters got the impression that a conservative government would have the money to fund their election promises, whereas a Labour government might not. Quite how the people of Northern Ireland might be persuaded to vote for a united Ireland and thus relieve the exchequer of this financial obligation was breezily passed over as a matter for the Irish to decide, although independent observers noted darkly that the swingeing cutbacks in Northern Ireland’s budget over the past two years might have been a preparation for just such an event, and there was some background talk that the Tories might be planning to escalate those cutbacks regardless of the border poll result. There was much talk of cutting out “wasteful spending” and “unsustainable subsidies” in the Tory manifesto without any official spokesperson ever conceding that such references applied especially to Northern Ireland, although many inferred that that was indeed the case. “Waste is waste wherever it occurs” is all that the spokespersons would concede. However, some reports noted that “the Northern Ireland health service cost far more, and delivered far less, than its counterpart in England, citing recent reports to that effect. This was, apparently, a general problem with public services in Northern Ireland. Although Labour had supported the principle of a united Ireland by consent since the 1980’s, Labour leader Keir Starmer denounced the border poll decision as an “electoral stunt” designed to distract people from the governments catastrophic economic record. While pledging to respect the democratic will of the people of Northern Ireland, Labour would be campaigning in favour of the union. Labour stood for a proudly British United Kingdom. He made the announcement flanked by unionist leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who looked incredibly pleased, and announced that “this showed that the British people are rallying behind the Union” and that “unionists would be supporting the formation of a Labour led government in the forthcoming election”. Starmer’s announcement led to an almost immediate and damaging split between the left and right wings of the Labour party, with left wingers denouncing Starmer as “more conservatives than the Conservatives themselves”. The charge struck a nerve, leading to angry exchanges between Starmer loyalists and most of the rest of the party. In vain Starmer noted that even the Irish government hadn’t called for a border poll, and that almost the only people welcoming it were Sinn Féin and dissident republicans engaged in terrorist activities (although there had been no significant recent dissident terrorist activity). Starmer even visited Dublin to sympathise with concerns that the border poll had been called “without due consultation and coordination with the Irish government beforehand”. It is not entirely clear his visit was welcomed by Dublin, however. Sinn Féin was quick to point out that while they had been successful in their campaign for border poll, the “conservative parties in Ireland were siding with the unionists, and that the people of Ireland had to be given an immediate opportunity to show whose side they were on.” Apparently both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were indisposed at the last moment, and Sir Keir was met by my old friend , the Junior minister, Neale Richmond, instead. I tried to contact Neale for a comment, but he didn’t return my calls. It seems my previous very positive interview with him had left no lasting impression on him. Opinion polling and focus group research in England found that the public largely agreed with Starmer’s claim that this was an electoral stunt designed to distract from the government’s catastrophic economic record. But they also didn’t seem to care over much as to why the government had made the announcement. They were intrigued by the possibilities it opened up for increased public spending in England, and they generally approved of the Conservatives plans to increase spending on the NHS, housing, tax breaks, and programmes to eliminate poverty. Faced with a newly united Conservative party and a divided Labour party, opinion polls showed a significant swing back to the Tories in the next few weeks. In my, somewhat cynical, view, the border poll announcement had already served its purpose. It had changed the electoral conversation to something more people could agree with and less damaging to the Tories. The fact that the border poll wasn’t due to take place until long after the general election meant that it could now be kicked into the long grass. If the Tories lost the election, it would be somebody else’s problem in any case. Opinion in Ireland, both North and south, was not quite so sanguine. — /To be continued: Chapter 3: The 2024 UK General Election",

      "title": "LPGA pro 'very shocked' outlet nixed story; says attention over playing pregnant 'renewed faith in humanity'",
      "text": "Golfer Amy Olson took the course for the 2023 U.S. Women’s Open in July for the seventh time in her career while facing a unique challenge. At seven months pregnant, Olson competing at Pebble Beach, one of golf’s greatest stages, was headline news. Her story was covered extensively even before she teed off, giving Olson a \"renewed faith in humanity\" due to what she perceived as a celebration of life. \"I didn't even expect the reaction when I played in the U.S. Open, seven months pregnant,\" Olson told Fox News Digital. \"I didn't expect that to get as big as it did. And to me, that was the most encouraging thing. It was like people are celebrating life no matter what your belief is on it or whatever. \"You're excited about the fact that I'm playing at seven months pregnant. And there's something different about that than when you're just playing another tournament. GOLF WRITER QUITS PUBLICATION AFTER HE SAYS OUTLET WOULDN'T PUBLISH PREGNANT GOLFER'S PRO-LIFE VIEWS \"I’ve played six other U.S. Opens in my career, and I never received the attention — especially leading up to the tournament — that I did this year. So, to me, that tells me that our culture intuitively knows there is something special and that life does matter even before it's born. So, to me, it was like, 'OK, I have a renewed faith in humanity.’ And that was exciting for me.\" Olson said her fellow competitors were nothing but supportive on the course. \"It was so supportive. Everybody was really excited for me, really proud of me,\" Olson said. \"I received nothing negative, honestly. Like nothing negative the entire week, especially from my peers. Everybody just wants to come up and touch your belly, which is a little bit different. That's not a normal experience on the golf course.\" While Olson had the support of her competitors and a good amount of media attention, not all the angles of Olson’s story made headline news, according to Steve Eubanks, a former senior writer at Global Golf Post. Eubanks told TheBlaze he was tasked with writing a preview piece covering the U.S. Women’s Open and chose Olson as the subject of his article. During his discussion with Olson, the LPGA golfer expressed her Christian and pro-life views, diving into the \"irony\" of the coverage of her competing while seven months pregnant, which coincided with the one-year anniversary of Roe v. Wade being overturned. Roe V. Wade was overturned June 24, 2022, and Olson teed off for the first round of the 2023 U.S. Women’s Open July 6, 2023. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM In the interview with Eubanks, Olson also discussed the challenges of being an outspoken Christian. According to Eubanks, the staff at the Global Golf Post \"went ballistic\" after he filed the story to the editorial team. \"About five hours into the editing process, I got calls from the editor saying, in his exact words, 'The staff is going nuts. They're saying we can't run this. I was fighting very vociferously to get it run, saying, 'It's news; we're a news outlet.' And the point I wanted to make — if she had said exactly the opposite, I still would have fought to put it in,\" Eubanks told \"TheBlaze.\" After several \"back-and-forth phone calls,\" Eubanks claims the editor-in-chief of Global Golf Post called and said, \"'The only way we will run this piece is if we take out the abortion and the Christian stuff.'\" Eubanks said he resigned on the spot after 12 years with the publication. \"That was anti-news and quite frankly anti-Christian. And I just couldn’t abide either of those, so I knew on the spot that I had to walk away,\" Eubanks told \"FOX and Friends.\" Asked her reaction to the piece not running, Olson told Fox News Digital she didn’t necessarily approach her interview with Eubanks wanting to discuss her views, instead wanting to discuss the two different experiences one year apart. ROSE ZHANG SAYS SHE WAS 'FLABBERGASTED' OVER TIGER WOODS TALK, REVEALS ADVICE FROM LPGA TOUR STARS \"Steve is a writer who has written articles about me in the past,\" Olson said. \"I know his style. I know he's fair. And so I felt comfortable speaking about the experience that I'd lived through in the last couple of years. One being, and just to put it succinctly, when Roe v. Wade was overturned, it seemed like you could only talk about the woman. You couldn't talk about the unborn baby involved. And then, all of a sudden, a year later, everybody wants to talk about this unborn baby that I'm carrying with me as I'm playing in a major championship. \"And I just spoke to him about that difference,\" she added. \"It wasn't even so much about my views on it, just that I was experiencing two very different things within a year.\" Olson said she was \"very shocked\" the story did not run while also \"extremely impressed\" with Eubanks for wanting to tell her entire story. \"I was, No. 1, very shocked that it didn't run, because I'm kind of the opinion that media wants to run anything that's going to get clicks and gain eyes,\" Olson said. \"And I figured that would. But then I was also extremely impressed with his, I guess his commitment to journalistic integrity and wanting to tell the full story and not editorialize. And so, to me. that was a huge stand of courage on his part.\" Global Golf Post had not responded to a request for comment by time of publication. According to Eubanks and Olson, the story was picked up by a writer from USA Today Golfweek, which planned on publishing a piece on \"the interview that never ran.\" Eubanks told \"TheBlaze\" he and Olson were interviewed for the story, which never made it to publication. Golfweek and USA Today had not responded to a request for comment from Fox News Digital by the time of publication. Olson was surprised by this because she had been quoted in a June 2022 story in Golfweek in which golfers of differing opinions on the overturning of Roe v. Wade were interviewed. \"The article that had been written in 2022 had expressed both opinions,\" Olson told Fox News Digital. \"There were athletes that came out in favor of Roe v. Wade being overturned and then others that were outraged about it. So, they kind of shared a really even perspective. \"And when they wanted to interview Steve and I about the story not running, I honestly thought that this was a no-brainer. And so when that one got shut down, I was like, ‘What is going on here? Maybe there's something a little more.’\" Olson hopes being outspoken will encourage others to stay strong in their beliefs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I would love to see people being more comfortable sharing,\" Olson told Fox News Digital. \"And even if it's disagreed with, I just think we should be able to have the conversation in a rational and an open dialog. It's the only way you find out if you're wrong about opinions is by hashing it out with people that disagree with you. We shouldn't fear that.\"I think the biggest thing to me is that little girl, that little boy out there who is thinking, ‘I think this way, but I don’t see anyone else that believes this.’ And maybe having one voice or one person that they hear, that can encourage them to stay strong in their belief.\" Olson missed the cut at the 2023 U.S. Women’s Open and is now on maternity leave.",

      "title": "Fans defend Kate Middleton after Vogue editor criticises her jewellery",
      "text": "The Princess of Wales’ fans have come to her defence after her taste in jewellery was criticised by former Vogue editor Suzy Menkes. Menkes described Kate Middleton’s jewellery choices as a “disappointment” during the newest episode of her podcast Creative Conversations, where she spoke with British Vogue’s jewellery editor Carol Woolton. “The Princess of Wales is a bit of a disappointment about jewellery,” Menkes said. “She gives the impression that she only puts it on when she absolutely has to. “I imagine her looking beautiful in one of those gowns behind the scenes and then pulling a face as if to say: ‘Do I have to wear this?’ She doesn’t give any sense of adoring jewellery and being pleased to put it on.” During the conversation, the former editor then alleged that Kate doesn’t have the same “joy” about wearing jewellery as Queen Camilla. “[Kate] doesn’t seem to have Camilla’s joy at wearing jewellery,” she said, before noting that, as Queen, Camilla “presumably has a first opportunity to look at the [royal family’s] jewels”. The comments have sparked criticism on social media, where many have defended Kate and her style choices. “Maybe, just maybe [Kate] is more focused on her job than looking like a fashionista. Typical superficial comment from someone who had an irrelevant job,” one person tweeted in response. Another said: “Princess of Wales is as glamorous as they come. She has a restrained elegance and always looks beautiful. The Vogue editor is wrong.” “Hmm…seems to be Catherine is a conservative jewellery wearer. There’s not a thing wrong with that at all,” someone else wrote. Another person defended Kate’s jewellery choices on the basis that she has “just the right mix of affordable and high-end jewellery”. “The Princess of Wales has an excellent eye for accessories, and her earrings collection is stunning - particularly because she often promotes small businesses by wearing their jewellery,” they wrote. “She has just the right mix of affordable and high-end jewellery in her wardrobe.” Someone else tweeted: “I have no love for royals but Kate is the absolute representation of elegance. If she is a disappointment then [I don’t know] what the expectation is anymore.” Others suggested that the Princess of Wales’ accessory choices reflect an awareness of the “current climate,” with one person questioning: “I wonder how it would go down if she wore a new designer outfit every day of the week and flaunted expensive jewellery - especially in this current climate?” The royal is known for mixing high-end and affordable pieces of jewellery, with Kate opting for a pair of $75 (£58) pearl earrings by Shyla for a recent appearance at Wimbledon. However, the Princess of Wales also has a number of notable jewels in her jewellery collection, including multiple pieces inherited from her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. Kate’s diamond and south sea pearl earrings are one such item, which the royal has worn on a number of recent occasions, including to the 2022 Royal Ascot, the first state visit of King Charles’ reign, and to the King and Queen’s coronation in May. For the occasion, Kate also wore a sequin and metallic beaded floral headpiece by Jess Collett x Alexander McQueen. In addition to Diana’s earrings, the Princess of Wales also inherited the late royal’s sapphire and diamond engagement ring. During the podcast conversation, Menkes also addressed some of the controversy surrounding the royal family’s jewellery collection, with the former magazine editor describing some of the pieces as “dubious”. “It’s one of these strange secrets,” she said. “It’s not discussed, and I can see why because some of the pieces are dubious. They came from India. “I won’t say they were stolen but they were perhaps given and taken by the British Royal Family. They weren’t stealing it but they were taking over a country at that time, and and taking jewels they thought were an attractive thing to take back to England with them.”",

      "title": "NBA Hall Of Fame: Every Team&#039;s Most Likely Next Inductee, From Lakers&#039; LeBron James To",
      "text": "The Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame is the pinnacle of achievement for every NBA player, coach and executive — a sign that your career was not only great but also worthy of immortalization. The 2023 class is riddled with familiar NBA names, including Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, Pau Gasol, Tony Parker and Gregg Popovich, who will all be inducted on Saturday. Like most of the sports world, we generally have a hard time living in the present and always want to look to the future, so we thought it would be interesting to take a look at all 30 NBA teams‘ current roster to see who their most likely next Hall of Fame inductee would be. Please note the key words there: First, “current roster” — the player has to be with the team at this very moment to be considered. Second, “most likely” — meaning we’re not saying that the person is certainly going to get in, but it is just the best candidate available. And lastly, “next,” indicating that the person selected has to be the one who’s going to reach the Hall of Fame the soonest. For the purposes of this exercise, we looked at players, coaches and members of the front office (we decided to leave owners and governors out, because that’s not much fun). As you’ll see, some are extremely obvious — hi, LeBron! — and others are true head-scratchers — Wizards, yeesh! Anyway, without further ado, here is every NBA franchise’s most likely next Hall of Famer. Also considered: Patty Mills, Quin Snyder, Dejounte Murray Mills probably presents the closest challenge to Young given his international contributions to the Australian national team, but it’s still a long shot given his modest NBA numbers and only a single title with the Spurs. Snyder is currently 56th on the all-time coaching wins list and is still without a championship, which means he’s got a ways to go before hitting Hall of Fame consideration. So, despite being only 24 years old, Young is most likely to be the Hawks’ next Hall of Famer. His numbers through his first five seasons put him on par with players like Clyde Drexler, Ray Allen and Kyrie Irving, and he’s shown no signs of slowing in terms of his scoring and assist output. Ultimately, even if Young isn’t ever the best player on a championship team, his numbers alone should eventually push him past the HOF threshold. Also considered: Jayson Tatum, Brad Stevens This would have been much easier had Blake Griffin re-signed with the Celtics at the time of this writing, but instead, he looms as a free agent. Therefore we have to delve into the murky waters of Horford’s Hall of Fame case, which is certainly in the eye of the beholder. At the end of the day, Horford’s consistency (five-time All-Star, one-time All-NBA and All-Defense), his varied skill set that involves switchability and 3-point shooting, plus his contributions in college (back-to-back titles at Florida) and on the international stage (three medals representing the Dominican Republic) make a strong case. He’s also one of four NBA players to notch at least 10,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, 1,000 blocks and 500 3-pointers. The others are LeBron James, Dirk Nowitzki and Shawn Marion (who has a similarly polarizing HOF candidacy). You’d have to imagine that if he is able to win a title before he retires, however, that could push Horford over the edge. The next pick would be Tatum, but he’s only 19 25 years old and has a long way to go. So for now, we’ll assume Horford has a couple more solid years left that could make his case a bit clearer. Also considered: Sean Marks Ben Simmons‘ trajectory would have made him the clear favorite for the Hall of Fame on the current Nets roster, but the last few seasons have obviously derailed that train. That leaves Brooklyn with very few candidates after the exodus of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden. Marks is a sneaky option, having keenly finagled a rapid return to contention following a disastrous depletion of assets by his predecessors. But, it’s incredibly difficult for front office executives to make the Hall of Fame as contributors, and, unfortunately, Marks’ legacy could be one of failure given the disappointment of his ignominious “superteam.” Therefore, despite its gross prematurity, we’re basically forced to go with Bridges, who showed last season that he could be capable of becoming — at the very least — a No. 2 option on an excellent NBA team. His Basketball Reference similarity scores through five seasons include Hall of Famers Chris Webber and Jamaal Wilkes, so there’s reason to believe that Bridges could join them if he stays along his current path. That’s just a very hard thing to predict since he’s entering his age-27 season. Also considered: LaMelo Ball, Mitch Kupchak Hayward’s chances probably aren’t great — he currently has a very slim Hall of Fame probability according to Basketball Reference — but he’s still the most likely candidate in the Hornets’ organization. His track record of staying healthy isn’t the best, but if Hayward, 33, can put together a few more productive seasons, it would at least make his case interesting. When looking at his career averages through over 600 games, he’s in the same region as Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday and Joe Johnson — all players potentially worthy of a Hall of Fame conversation. The other options for Charlotte were Ball and Kupchak, and you can’t really feel comfortable with either. Ball hasn’t even played 200 career games, and Kupchak hasn’t made a significant enough mark as an executive to merit induction as a contributor. Therefore we’re left with Hayward despite his steep, uphill battle to get into the HOF. Also considered: Billy Donovan, Zach LaVine While Donovan should have an interesting case by the time he retires, there’s very little doubt that DeRozan will end up in Springfield, especially if he keeps up his production for the next few seasons. The 34-year-old has averaged over 20 points for 10 consecutive years, earning six All-Star appearances and three All-NBA selections. He’s 39th on the all-time NBA scoring list, and will only continue to climb. LaVine is probably going to have a strong case by the time he hangs them up, but since we’re talking about the most likely next Hall of Famer, it has to be DeRozan. Also considered: Ricky Rubio Rubio is worthy of consideration given his crucial role in the success of Spain’s national team, but his NBA credentials leave a bit to be desired when it comes to the Hall of Fame. If we assume Rubio falls short, that only leaves Mitchell as the next probable candidate. The 6-1 guard is a prolific scorer, averaging at least 20 points in all six of his NBA seasons and getting up to 28 in his first season with the Cavs. There’s no reason to believe that, if he stays healthy, Mitchell won’t be a lock to make the Hall of Fame by the time he retires. Also considered: Luka Doncic With head coach Jason Kidd already in the Hall, that leaves Irving as the most likely candidate to get in next. Basketball Reference has Irving with a 0.94 chance of getting in, as close to a lock as it gets, and he should still have several prime years remaining. Availability has been an issue throughout his career, but there’s never been a doubt regarding his on-court production, averaging at least 24 points and five assists per game in each of the last seven seasons. He also hit arguably the most clutch shot in NBA history to deliver the Cavs their only title. If voters decide to hold Irving out for whatever reason, Doncic would be next in line for the Mavericks franchise — but at 24 years old, that’s a long way off. Also considered: Michael Malone, Jamal Murray Any doubts about Jokic’s potential Hall of Fame status were eliminated when he went on one of the most devastating postseason runs of all time to lead Denver to its first NBA title a couple of months ago. At 28 years old, the two-time MVP could have more on the way, and he’ll almost certainly add to his five All-Star and All-NBA selections — unless he gets sick of playing basketball and decides to race horses full time back in Serbia. Malone is 53rd on the all-time NBA coaching wins list, so he could eventually get to the HOF level, but that will take considerable time. Same with Murray, whose per-game production indicates a potential Hall of Fame career, but we’ll need to see if he stays on the court. Anyway, this one was easy. It’s Jokic. Also considered: Bojan Bogdanovic Bogdanovic is the closest thing to a Hall of Famer the Pistons currently have on their roster, and he would need an improbably productive back half of his career to even get on the radar. So instead we turn to coaching, where Williams should have a decent shot of getting in if he continues to have success. Williams won Coach of the Year with the Suns in 2021-22, and is a two-time NBCA Coach of the Year Award recipient. He ranks 57th in all-time wins, and he’ll continue to move up the ranks after locking himself into a six-year, $78.5 million contract with Detroit. Cade Cunningham is probably the most likely player to ascend to Hall of Fame status, but he’s appeared in just 76 NBA games, so it’s way too early to make that assumption. Also considered: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green The Warriors have four stone-cold Hall of Fame locks, so this is really just a prediction about who will retire first — and that’s most likely Paul. While Curry, Thompson and Green still appear to be going strong, Paul has clearly shown signs of decline both physically and on the floor over the past couple of seasons. When he does decide to retire, Paul will go into the Hall of Fame as arguably the best point guard of all time — the “Point God,” as he’s come to be known. He ranks third all-time in both assists and steals, is a 12-time All-Star, 11-time All-NBA selection, nine-time All-Defense selection and a member of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. He also has two Olympic gold medals and numerous collegiate accolades from his days at Wake Forest. All he’s missing is an NBA title, which he hopes to collect in his first season with the Warriors. Curry, Thompson and Green will likely have their turn, but it appears Paul will be the next Warrior to grace the Basketball Hall of Fame with his presence. Also considered: Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun Well, this is a tough one. Green and Sengun have both shown promise in their first two NBA seasons, but they’re far too early in their careers to even mention the words “Hall of Fame.” Ime Udoka is in just his second season as an NBA head coach. So that leaves us with the only veteran on the team who really has a conceivable shot, and that’s VanVleet — but it’s going to take steady production for the rest of the 29-year-old’s career. The good news is he was already a vital part of a championship team, but he also has just one All-Star appearance and has yet to make an All-NBA or All-Defensive team. VanVleet has a chance to take his game to another level with an intriguing Rockets group, but as of now, Basketball Reference has him at a 0.0030 probability of making the Hall of Fame. That said, he’s probably the best this current Rockets roster has to offer. Also considered: Buddy Hield, Myles Turner, Tyrese Haliburton Haliburton and Turner are too early in their careers to call them Hall of Fame locks, and Hield will have an interesting case given his prolific 3-point shooting. But ultimately the next Hall of Famer from the Pacers has to be Carlisle, who is 14th in NBA history in coaching wins and led the 2011 Mavericks to an improbable Finals win over the LeBron James-Dwyane Wade-Chris Bosh “superteam” Miami Heat. Carlisle also won Coach of the Year in 2002 with the Detroit Pistons, bolstering what should be a Hall of Fame career when he decides to call it quits. Also considered: Kawhi Leonard, Paul George Another team with three surefire Hall of Famers, the Clippers’ next representative comes down to who will retire first between Westbrook, Leonard and George. Considering Leonard and George are younger, play highly coveted NBA positions, and are still performing at All-Star levels when healthy, it’s safe to assume that the 34-year-old Westbrook will be the first to call it quits. There’s always the outside chance, however, that Westbrook just heads overseas and plays until he’s 60 because he just loves the game that much. Time will tell. In any case, four years after whenever Westbrook decides to retire, he’ll enter the Hall of Fame as one of the most unique and prolific NBA players of all time. Assuming a relatively productive upcoming season, he will quickly join LeBron James as the only players in league history to put up at least 25,000 points, 9,000 rebounds and 8,000 assists in a career. Westbrook is also the only player to average a triple-double in multiple seasons (four times) and he won the 2016-17 MVP by putting up a ridiculous 31.6 points, 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists per game. Also considered: Anthony Davis The only hair of uncertainty about the Lakers’ next Hall of Famer is if LeBron decides to play until he’s 50 and outlasts Davis — and it’s pretty insane that we can’t definitively rule that out. In all likelihood though, James will retire in the next few years and will become the next Laker to be enshrined in Springfield. We don’t need to list all the accolades and accomplishments for a player who’s the greatest of all time in some peoples’ books, but the fact that he’s the NBA’s all-time leading scorer and fourth in career assists speaks volumes about his ability to both takeover games individually and facilitate for his teammates. The scary part is, LeBron is still performing at an All-NBA level with very few signs of decline. Also considered: Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr. Rose isn’t a surefire bet to make the Hall of Fame, but he’s been able to put together a solid post-injury career that has complemented the dynamic, explosive form of his early NBA days. Basketball Reference has his Hall of Fame probability around that of inductees Bobby Jones, Pete Maravich and Spencer Haywood, so that could bode well for Rose’s chances. Prior to devastating knee injuries, Rose was a Rookie of the Year, MVP, three-time All-Star and one-time All-NBA selection. In the later portion of his career, Rose averaged over 18 points per game during stints with the Knicks, Timberwolves and Pistons. With Morant and Jackson still so young, Rose is probably the best bet for the Hall of Fame on the current Grizzlies roster. Also considered: Erik Spoelstra, Kevin Love, Jimmy Butler Spoelstra, Love and Butler are all locks to make the Hall of Fame, but the best bet to be the next inductee is the 37-year-old Lowry, who appears to be nearing the tail-end of his career. After bouncing around for the early part of his career, Lowry found a home in Toronto, where he helped lead the Raptors to the 2019 title by logging 26 points and 10 assists on 4-for-7 3-point shooting in the clinching Game 6 win over the Warriors. Lowry is one of three players in league history (LeBron James, James Harden) to notch over 15,000 points, 6,000 assists and 2,000 3-pointers in an NBA career. He’s also a six-time All-Star and one-time All-NBA selection. Also considered: Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, Giannis Antetokounmpo We all know Giannis is the headliner here, but at just 28 years old he’s still a long way from entering the Hall of Fame. That leaves three borderline potential Bucks inductees in Lopez, Middleton and Holiday. Basketball Reference has Middleton with the highest probability, but he’s only 31 and has a lot of time left on the court. A 35-year-old center with plenty of miles on his basketball odometer, Lopez seems closest to retirement — but he’s not exactly a shoo-in for the Hall of Fame. Ultimately he should have a strong case given the second act of his career that he’s pulled off in Milwaukee, becoming a prolific 3-point shooter while also in the Defensive Player of the Year conversation from season to season. This is in addition to his early days with the Nets, where he averaged 19 points, seven rebounds and nearly two blocks per game over nine seasons. Lopez is a one-time All-Star, a two-time All-Defense selection and won the 2021 title with Milwaukee. He’s also the only player in NBA history to put up at least 1,700 blocks and 700 3-pointers, which could help his Hall of Fame case — especially if he has a few more years of solid production. Minnesota Timberwolves: Rudy Gobert Also considered: Mike Conley, Karl-Anthony Towns, Anthony Edwards Conley is most likely going to be the first of this group to retire, but it’s hard to imagine him making it into the Hall of Fame. He’s a one-time All-Star and All-Defensive player, and despite his memorable playoff runs with the Grit-N-Grind Grizzlies, he has no titles to show for it. As such, Basketball Reference has him with a 0.0069 Hall of Fame probability, around players like Pascal Siakam and Udonis Haslem. So that leaves us with Gobert, who, at 31, is a long way from retirement, but will be pretty much a lock to get into the Hall of Fame with a few more productive seasons. He’s one of four players in league history to win three Defensive Player of the Year Awards, is a six-time All-Defense selection, four-time All-NBA selection, three-time All-Star and has led the league in both blocks and rebounding. When he decides to retire, Gobert shouldn’t have a problem getting in. Also considered: CJ McCollum, David Griffin, Zion Williamson McCollum has averaged at least 20 points for the past eight seasons, but with no All-Star or All-NBA selections it’s going to be very difficult to make a legitimate Hall of Fame case. And while Griffin has made some shrewd moves, the standard for getting in as a front office executive is hard to breach. Finally, as dynamic as Williamson is, he hasn’t been on the court often enough to merit even the most premature Hall of Fame discussion. Therefore, despite being just 25 years old, Ingram is the most logical choice to be the Pelicans’ next Hall of Famer. He won the Most Improved Player award in 2019-20, when he earned his first All-Star appearance. Availability has been an issue, but he’s put up at least 23 points per game in each of the past four seasons, including a career-high 24.7 last year. He still has a long way to go, to be sure, but the path to the Hall of Fame is clearer for Ingram than any other current member of the Pelicans. New York Knicks: Tom Thibodeau Also considered: Julius Randle, Jalen Brunson With no current players on the verge of enshrinement, the Knicks’ most likely next Hall of Famer is Tom Thibodeau, currently 39th on the all-time wins list after head coaching stints with the Bulls, Timberwolves and Knicks. He’s a two-time Coach of the Year recipient (2011, 2021) and finished second and third in two other seasons. The most likely players to have a shot are Randle and Brunson, but both must put up many more accolade-filled seasons to even get into the conversation. At this point, Thibodeau seems like the most likely pick. Also considered: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander As we’ve mentioned a few times in this story, it’s very difficult for a front office executive to make the Hall of Fame. Former Bulls exec Jerry Krause is the most recent example of a general manager making it in, but they are few and far between. That being said, Presti has set up the Thunder to be a very special franchise, and it’s largely due to his vision and execution. He’s led the way in the recent trend of asset collection and trading stars at the peak of their value, so he could truly be perceived as a historic influence, particularly if he ends up winning a title or two. The closest thing to a Hall of Fame player on the young Thunder roster is Gilgeous-Alexander, but he’s just beginning his ascent to stardom. Because of that, we’ll go with Presti as OKC’s most likely next Hall of Famer. Also considered: Joe Ingles, Franz Wagner, Wendell Carter Jr. Young team. Young coach. First-year GM. This is a tough one. The only vet on the Magic roster who may have a shot is Ingles, but his Hall of Fame probability is .00002, according to Basketball Reference. So it really comes down to the newbies on the roster and projecting which one has the best chance. Jalen Suggs has shown flashes, but he’s not really shown star potential yet. Carter is solid, but doesn’t have a Hall of Fame-level game at this point. So that essentially leaves Wagner and Banchero, who both have the potential to be great NBA players. While Wagner has been excellent in his two seasons and possesses an incredibly versatile game on both ends, former No. 1 overall pick Banchero probably has a better shot at being the guy, which could eventually lead to the Hall of Fame. Again, this is all rampant speculation, but there really weren’t any other options given the current Magic roster. Also considered: Joel Embiid, Daryl Morey Embiid will get in one day, but he’s only 29. Morey has a shot, but he’d need to get in as a contributor, and he’s still yet to win a title. So, since he’s technically still on the 76ers roster (for now), Harden is their most likely next Hall of Famer. Say what you will about the aesthetics of his game and his penchant for changes of scenery, but the man has put up unassailable Hall of Fame production over the course of his career, which could still have several years left. He’s an MVP, a ten-time All-Star, a seven-time All-NBA selection, a three-time scoring champion, a two-time assist leader and a Sixth Man of the Year. Harden made the NBA 75th Anniversary Team, and currently sits 25th all-time in both total points and assists. Harden is undoubtedly going into the Hall of Fame, and at 33 years old, he’ll probably get there before Embiid and/or Morey. Phoenix Suns: Kevin Durant Also considered: Devin Booker, Bradley Beal No doubt about this one. Booker will almost certainly get in one day, and Beal has an outside shot. But Durant is absolutely the most probable choice to be the next Suns Hall of Famer. The 34-year-old is currently 13th on the all-time scoring list and rising, and he collected two NBA Finals MVPs while winning back-to-back championships with the Warriors. The accolades speak for themselves: MVP, 13-time All-Star, 10-time All-NBA, four-time scoring champion, NBA 75th Anniversary team. And the scary part about Durant is that he appears to be getting even better with age — his .677 true shooting percentage last season was the best of his career, while averaging nearly 30 points. Durant is truly one of the special ones, and he’s a lock to be the next Phoenix Sun in the Hall of Fame. Also considered: Chauncey Billups Let’s hurry up and get this published while he’s still on the team! Lillard is a 100 percent lock to be a Hall of Famer, and there’s nobody else really in the Blazers organization who could get there before him. Billups is an interesting case since he’s still eligible to get in as a player, but he’s never been a finalist. Plus, Billups getting in as a player who never suited up for the Blazers would kind of miss the point of this exercise. So Lillard it is, who is in the top 60 all-time in scoring and sixth in career 3-pointers made. Both those rankings will surely go up quickly as Lillard, 33, is coming off arguably his best season with averages of 32.2 points, 7.3 assists and 4.8 rebounds per game on 46/37/91 shooting splits. He may not finish his career with the Blazers, but he’s almost certainly going to be the next Portland representative in the Hall of Fame. Also considered: Domantas Sabonis, Mike Brown Sabonis actually has the higher probability according to Basketball Reference (Fox has yet to crack the list), but we’re going to take some liberties based on the progression we saw last season. After winning the league’s inaugural Clutch Player of the Year Award, Fox was an absolute menace in the Kings’ opening-round playoff loss to the Warriors, averaging 27.4 points, 7.7 assists and 5.4 rebounds in the seven-game series. This came after a regular season in which Fox put up 25 points and 6.1 assists per game en route to his first All-Star and All-NBA selections. Sabonis may have a slightly more accomplished career so far, but the trajectory that Fox is on seems more likely to end up in Springfield someday. Also, don’t sleep on Brown, a two-time Coach of the Year who is 54th all-time in NBA wins. He just seems a bit farther off from the Hall of Fame than Fox at this point. San Antonio Spurs: R.C. Buford Also considered: Victor Wembanyama This would have been a much easier exercise this time last year, but with Gregg Popovich being inducted on Saturday, it leaves slim pickings on the young, largely unproven Spurs roster. The quick and easy answer would be Wembanyama, but we simply can’t predict that someone who’s never played an NBA game is going to make the Hall of Fame, despite whatever impossibly lofty expectations have already been bandied about. So instead we’ll move to the front office, where Buford has been a strong voice in San Antonio since 1994, and was the general manager for four Spurs titles before being promoted to CEO in 2019. He’s also a two-time winner of NBA Executive of the Year, helping to helm one of the great dynasties in sports history. The path to the Hall of Fame for executives is a difficult one, but the induction of Jerry Krause in 2017 could open the door for decorated, influential front-office mavens like Buford. Toronto Raptors: Masai Ujiri Also considered: Pascal Siakam Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan will likely be the next Raptors in the Hall of Fame, but they’re not currently on the roster, so we had to get a bit creative. Siakam is an excellent player, but at this point it’s hard to say with certainty that the Hall of Fame is in his future — his probability is 0.0067, according to Basketball Reference. A more likely next Hall of Famer is Ujiri, who earned Executive of the Year honors with the Denver Nuggets before becoming the architect of the only Raptors championship in franchise history in 2019. He famously pulled off the trade that landed Kawhi Leonard, who wound up being the Finals MVP. Ujiri has also done important work with the NBA’s Basketball Without Borders Africa program, which would certainly be considered on his potential Hall of Fame resumé. Also considered: None No player on the current Jazz roster could even be mentioned in the same sentence as “Hall of Fame,” so thank goodness that Ainge is the one calling the shots in the front office. Some have campaigned for him to get into Springfield as a player, but the more likely path is that Ainge gets in as a contributor for his work with the Boston Celtics and, now, the Jazz. Ainge’s most notable move with the Celtics was bringing in Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the same summer to join Paul Pierce, which paid immediate dividends with the 2008 championship. Ainge is also known as somewhat ruthless, later trading away an aging Garnett and Pierce for draft picks that became Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. He also traded fan-favorite Isaiah Thomas for Kyrie Irving in 2017. The trend continued in Utah, where Ainge dealt away franchise cornerstones Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert in the summer of 2022, bringing in a stockpile of draft picks and promising young players like 2022-23 All-Star Lauri Markkanen. Ainge has become synonymous with shrewd front-office decision-making, so he should have a decent shot of getting into the Hall of Fame. Also considered: Jordan Poole Of all the franchises to pick a next Hall of Famer, Washington is probably the most difficult. Head coach Wes Unseld Jr. is still unproven, new front-office head Michael Winger has only been a prominent executive for six years, and the team just traded away its only fringe Hall of Fame candidates in Bradley Beal and Kristaps Porzingis. With that being the case, Kuzma seems to be the most likely next Hall of Famer of the bunch — but that certainly doesn’t mean we’re endorsing his candidacy. One selling point for Kuzma is that he was already an important piece on a championship team with the Lakers, so that’s one box checked off. He’s also shown more all-around growth in his two seasons with Washington, increasing his scoring, rebounding and assist averages significantly and setting the foundation for an interesting trajectory. Kuzma is in a similar situation to Poole, where they should both get plenty of opportunity to put up numbers for at least next season and maybe beyond. Perhaps that means that they compile enough career points to make things interesting, and then become a key piece of a title team down the road? Yeah, we’re grasping at straws — but we had to pick someone, and Kuzma seems like the best of limited options.",

      "title": "What’s Behind the Youth Unemployment Statistics Beijing Just Decided to Stop Publishing?",
      "text": "This week, China’s National Bureau of Statistics announced it would cease collecting data on youth unemployment. The news came after nearly a decade of poor job prospects for Chinese people ages 16-24, often reported on by international media as mainly a problem affecting recent college graduates. Earlier this summer, ChinaFile’s Jessica Batke spoke with sociologist Eli Friedman, who studies international labor, about the reasons for joblessness among China’s young people and how it is covered. Jessica Batke: If you’re graduating right now in China, if you’re coming on the labor market, what do you see in front of you? What are you worried about? Eli Friedman: Well, you’d be worried about getting a job! That structural reality is very much at the forefront of what college graduates in China are thinking about, and it is a big change from much of the past generation. Since the violent suppression of the student-led movement in 1989, the state struck a basic deal with college graduates, as well as intellectuals and youth more broadly: If they stayed out of politics and they could get into college, they’d pretty much be guaranteed a decent job that would allow them to live a life significantly more materially comfortable than their parents’ or their grandparents’. That worked really well in the 1990s, in the 2000s, through the turbulence of the 2008 crisis, and into the 2010s. Yet, even before COVID, we’d begun to see cracks in that system. COVID is its own unique moment in all of this, but coming out of COVID the underlying stresses on the system have become really apparent. The previous reality—that if you went to college, you’d be likely to graduate and get a job that allowed you to live a life that more or less matched your expectations—is increasingly not the case. People go to college and might not get a job at all. Or they might get a job but the pay, the conditions, and the hours mean that they are not going to be able to live a life that matches their aspirations. In some cases, the gap is dramatic. So there’s a lot of anxiety, and, in some cases, fear—or just “giving up.” There is also the question of overseas students. For a long time, studying abroad in the United States, or in one of the other Anglophone countries, was seen as, if not a golden ticket, at least a pretty solid pathway to the middle class. That is no longer the case. We see that even students who have gotten into reasonably competitive universities in the U.S. or elsewhere are now worried about going back to China. There’s no guarantee that they will be able to get jobs either. So studying overseas used to get you a little bit of an extra edge, and it really doesn’t do much for you anymore? I think it does help some in certain industries, but a couple things have changed. One is that Chinese universities have gotten a lot better. The gap between a competitive school in the United States and a competitive school in China has shrunk. Chinese employers are seeing that and saying, “We can hire someone who went to one of the 211 or the 985 universities in China [which have been designated by the government as top-tier institutions], and they’re going to be just as well-trained, and possibly better trained, than if they went to a school in the U.S. or the U.K.” And in general, I think it’s better for students to be able to go to high-quality higher education institutions closer to home. It’s definitely a lot cheaper as compared to the United States, graduating with debt or having your family invest hundreds of thousands of dollars. In terms of Chinese labor market dynamics, being able to say that you speak English is no longer the major mark of distinction that it might have been 20 or 30 years ago. And while the cachet of studying abroad has not been completely eliminated, I think employers are much more sensitive now. Looking at someone’s resume, they’re able to tell the difference between some very elite school like Harvard or Yale versus a fine-but-maybe-less-elite public school. So it’s a little bit more complicated than it was a generation ago. So are more of the Chinese students studying overseas trying to stay abroad rather than return home? In the U.S., everyone’s talking about how hot the labor market is, which would suggest there are jobs available, but the government also maintains lots of visa restrictions. Do you have any sense of what these students are doing? I don’t have any data on that, but I have seen data indicating the number of Chinese students coming to the United States has decreased. That’s for a number of reasons. Again, educational opportunities are better in China than they were a decade or two ago. In certain cases, U.S.-China hostility has made it more difficult administratively, or people have fears about being caught up in the China Initiative, which unfairly targeted people who are Chinese. But also, I think, because of a general sense of hostility; if you want to study something that’s potentially related to national security, why even bother? I believe, although I’m not 100 percent certain, that many Chinese students studying overseas have just gone to other Anglophone countries, like the U.K. So I don’t think it’s a general pulling back from study abroad, but specifically an issue with the U.S. In terms of where Chinese students are going after they graduate: This is super anecdotal, but based on the students that I encounter here at Cornell, I’ve seen a clear shift towards more students wanting to stay in the U.S. This is part of a cultural shift that came out of COVID—so-called “runxue,” or “running away.” It includes people of that generation who are worried about what their futures will be like in China and are pretty eager to find ways to stay in other countries—the major challenges of staying in the United States notwithstanding, including visa restrictions and concerns about anti-Asian racism. Whether or not more people actually are going to stay in the U.S. after they graduate, I don’t know, I haven’t seen that data. But just in terms of my cultural currents, it’s clear to me more people are like, “If I can stay here, I would really like to do that.” What is driving the change in unemployment for young people? You said COVID was kind of its own thing, but that we were seeing some cracks in the system even before COVID—so it seems like there are longer-standing issues at play here. It certainly feels to me like I’ve seen news articles every summer for the last 10 years about graduate unemployment in China. Is this year actually any different than the last five or 10 years, in terms of unemployment? Is it just an issue of degree? Or is there a qualitative shift that’s making this different than before? The number for youth unemployment this year and last year is actually just about the same. If you go back and look at a year ago . . . I forget the exact unemployment figure, but it was also around 20 percent. I should first say when I saw that number last year, I was shocked. My jaw dropped. For a long time, labor scholars had just assumed that unemployment numbers in China were manufactured. Unemployment rates going back for a couple of decades hover around 4 percent, with tiny little fluctuations. So I and most people thought, whatever, it’s one of the many manufactured numbers in China. And so when I saw this number I was like, OK, maybe China really had a very, very stable labor market for many decades. I mean, I don’t know, you never know with these things. But in any event, it was quite an acknowledgment of a systemic problem, if not a systemic failure. This is speculation, but I think the youth unemployment issue has gotten even more attention this year because China is through with lockdowns. Last summer, China was still in the midst of all of the lockdowns, and so everyone knew that there was “artificial constraining,” particularly of consumption. It had a big effect on manufacturing as well. We saw it with COVID lockdowns in places like Foxconn and the Tesla factory and elsewhere. There was a sense that the state had taken extreme measures, restricting the economy and driving up unemployment. But we all knew that, at a certain point, the lockdowns were going to end, China’s economy would roar back to life, these problems would dissipate, and we’d go back to the previous three decades of the China boom. (I never thought that was going to be the case, but there was some hope, maybe some wishful thinking, that it would be.) Fast forward to 2023. The lockdowns have ended chaotically, disastrously, and tragically. There was a brief burst of economic activity, or “revenge spending,” as well as increases in exports and what looked like some stabilization in the real estate market. But that very quickly petered out. It became clear by the spring that there was not going to be a return to pre-COVID assumptions about growth. One of the reasons I think the numbers hit a little bit harder in 2023 than in 2022 is because we now understand there’s no easy fix. Last year the easy fix was to end the lockdowns, like the rest of the world had done, and get back to normal. That’s not true this year, and it raises a whole series of much more difficult questions about what ought to be done in order to address unemployment. COVID, geopolitics, a lot of things that nobody could have predicted that put new pressures on the Chinese economy. But, if you look at the broad structural tendencies over the last 10 years, some very serious changes were always going to be necessary. That has only been intensified by contingent things like lockdowns and geopolitics. What were the needed changes? The main thing is the drivers of the Chinese economy, which have been exports and investment. Exports are particularly important in the economically dynamic regions of the Pearl River Delta and the Yangtze River Delta. They are in many ways the foundation of the China boom that took off in the 1990s—a model of growth predicated on wage suppression. The whole comparative advantage that China had, as identified by the leadership in the 1980s, was this large, relatively well-educated, very cheap workforce. It allowed them to conduct production on a scale that was unimaginable for the other East Asian Tigers, like Taiwan and South Korea, which couldn’t compete on scale, or, at that point, on the price of labor or land. But then the cost of land and labor went up quite a lot—which I think is a good thing—but it meant that, purely on the basis of the cheapness of labor, China was no longer competitive. This was already true in the early 2010s. Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, places in Latin America—wages are all cheaper in those places. And wages are much cheaper in India. So they needed to find new ways of competing and manufacturing. The state was very clear on the need to move from a so-called labor intensive form of manufacturing to a capital- and knowledge-intensive form of manufacturing. Rather than making toys, socks, and little gadgets, they want to be making high-end electronics, medical equipment, and cars. They want to be engaged in leading-edge technologies, like electric cars, which they’ve been pretty successful at. But making that switch means it’s less labor intensive. If you have a highly automated form of production that’s turning out something very expensive, like an electric vehicle, you’re absorbing less of the labor force. The other piece is around investments. That’s the other thing that’s really driving growth. Especially after 2008, you saw much more employment going into construction—building infrastructure, building buildings, building real estate, and all of the associated industries related to the building of things. Steel, concrete. . . Steel, concrete, electric wiring, things like that. It touches on manufacturing as well, because as people are building houses, they have to buy furniture and dishware and all the things that people put in houses. Manufacturing jobs in China peaked a long time ago, in the mid-2000s, even before the 2008 crisis. Employment in construction continued to go up because of all of the building, particularly after the 2008 crisis, when the state pumped $586 billion into the economy, which mostly ended up in infrastructure spending and the real estate boom. Spending on infrastructure, which is debt-financed, has come up against some real limits. We see this with local government fiscal stress and their inability to service their debts. We also see it in the real estate market: [major property developer] Evergrande just announced losses of [$81 billion] for the last two years. That’s just one indicator of how badly the real estate market has [done], for all sorts of reasons. China’s population is shrinking. The cost of housing is just absolutely exorbitant. To bring us back to the question of employment: the big economic drivers, which had been absorbing tens of millions of people migrating from the countryside into the city, are not really driving that much employment anymore. So the shift that China has to make, and that economists and the Communist Party have known about for two decades, is the shift to consumption-led growth. Premier Wen Jiabao was talking about it in 2004, almost 20 years ago. If you look at progress since 2004, consumption as a share of GDP is still down. Services already do absorb a majority of employment in China, more than in the secondary industries of manufacturing and construction. But the kinds of service sector jobs that are being created are pretty menial. And this is another really important feature when we think about how this shift is playing out. And when we think about the college grads. But if jobs are shifting away from manufacturing and towards services—knowing that some of the service jobs are menial—it still seems like there should be more jobs for college graduates. Why are there no jobs for these folks? One point that is important, and is often missed in a lot of the media coverage: Media coverage is very focused on the college grads. I understand why that is. As a college professor, I think about college grads a lot. But the number that is always cited, the 21 percent unemployment figure, Is for all 16-to-24-year-olds. Within that, the proportion of people who are college grads is actually quite small. In China, you have nine years of compulsory education. In the ninth year—that’s age 14 or so—you take the high school entrance exam, and then you get tracked out. Some people go on to the academic high school route—and most of the people tracked into the academic high school route do get into university nowadays—but most people don’t make it onto that track. They either stop education after Year 9 or they go get some supplementary technical education. So, if you’re looking at ages 16 to 24, it’s only the 23 and 24 year olds that could conceivably be university grads. Everyone else in that age group are people who’ve already left school and are looking for work. I actually didn’t piece that together when I first saw those numbers last year. But then when it hit me, I was like, “This is much scarier than I thought.” If you think of youth unemployment as just college grads, then you lean into the discourse—which is not untrue, but it’s only a partial truth—that college grads don’t want to take jobs in manufacturing, or they don’t want to get a job as a factory worker or in a restaurant. But, actually, the majority of these people did not go to university, and they’re still not getting jobs. That’s the thing that really worries me. It’s not just people turning their noses up at jobs that they think don’t befit a college-educated person. It’s people who are just not getting jobs at all. Talking about the university grads more specifically: People take jobs because they need enough money to live the life that they want to live. But the gap between the life that they want to live and the jobs that are available is incommensurable right now. You can think about that in a couple of ways. For one, the kinds of service sector jobs that are overwhelmingly being produced just don’t pay you enough to live in the big cities where most college grads want to live. The income-to-housing ratio in large Chinese cities is among the worst in the world. It makes New York City look kind of affordable. So if you take the jobs that are available, then you’re not going to be able to buy a house. If you can’t buy a house, you won’t be able to get your kid into school. That is because employment in the formal sector and home ownership are often required to access [residence permits known as] hukou—without establishing hukou you can be denied access to a range of social services including public education, health care, and pensions. Now, there are other kinds of jobs which might pay you enough to live that kind of life. But these jobs raise the whole “996” issue—working 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., six days a week. You might have enough money to buy a house, buy a car, and maybe to pay so someone else can raise your child. But I think a lot of young people are not into that anymore. That was really dramatized when all of the 996 activism was happening among tech workers two or three years ago. And, there’s a kind of generational difference. Back when [Alibab founder] Jack Ma was still making public appearances in China, he was kind of berating young people, very dismissive of them, when he said it’s a “blessing” to be able to do 996 when you’re in your 20s—this is what you do when you’re a young person, you devote your entire life to working hard and you can enjoy life later. That fell really flat with young people in China who didn’t grow up in desperate poverty in the way that people who were in their 50s or 60s did. This idea that you have to eat bitterness for decades before you can take a breather . . . if you grow up living middle class life in a big city in China, you’re thinking, “Maybe there’s more to life than just working all the time.” So, the jobs that are being created right now are either not paying young people enough to live in the city, or they do pay enough but people then can’t live the kind of life that they would like to live. That’s part of the challenge for the college grad specifically. If you’re the Chinese government, what are your range of options to deal with this? Or what might leaders be thinking about to try to engineer this economic shift? I assume they don’t have infinite time to make the shift, that there will eventually come an inflection point? There’s not an endless amount of time. If they don’t make a serious intervention, the vitality of growth will gradually be sapped, because they can’t depend on exports. We already see a reorganization of global supply chains away from China. Supply chains are not leaving China by any means, but China is going to be less central to the production of all kinds of commodities in the next few years. The debt piece is also really important to the extent that households and governments are using their money to service debt rather than making productive investments. That’s also going to undermine the vitality of growth. So it will be a long, slow decline. If I were a betting person, I would put my money on that, because the other options—which have been known for a long time, which are actually pretty clear, and not all that controversial for economists—are very difficult politically. They’re very difficult because the system of growth for the last 30 years has created very rich and very politically-connected constituencies that don’t want to change. Let’s think about real estate and exporters as key groups in all of this. With respect to exporters, if you want to shift from the current wage repression model to one predicated on a virtuous cycle of higher wages and higher consumption, you have to do two main things. One is you have to raise wages, obviously. One way to deal with this is to allow unions to bargain and collectively push up wages above what the market would determine on its own. The Chinese state is not willing to consider unions, because it thinks they pose a threat to political stability. Another option is that the state could just dictate. It could say, “In this industry, here’s what wages are going to be. We’re going to have dramatic increases in the minimum wage.” There were significant minimum wage hikes during the 2010s, but those increases have slowed considerably since Xi Jinping came to power. The state hasn’t done that. And so the question is, if there is already a dictatorial state, why can’t it just say, “Pay the workers more”? Because doing so would be a political problem. Whole economies are organized around exports; exporters and associated industries are very politically powerful. They have said, “We don’t want that,” and the Party has more or less gone along with it. The other side Is social protections: Health care. Pensions are particularly important. Education. If you talk to Chinese people about why they’re not spending money, their biggest concerns are about the future. For example, “How much is it going to cost for me to educate my child?” Officially, compulsory education is free in China, and that is in a sense true. Increasingly, buying a house in the catchment area of a good school has become a more expensive proposition in the biggest cities. This is something Americans can certainly relate to. You’re not formally paying tuition for schools, but you are in essence paying for schools via the real estate market. On healthcare, the state has increased investments in health insurance, but it remains extremely patchy, particularly for migrant workers. The subsidies offered in rural areas are wildly inadequate. Hundreds of millions of people fear they are one major illness away from bankruptcy. There’s no national healthcare system, and there’s no indication that they are considering the sort of comprehensive national system such as exists in many countries. Finally, pensions are really a big issue, and they’re very, very politically complicated. Because society is aging, there are more and more people of retirement age. (China has a pretty low retirement age, 60 for men and 55 For women, which they have considered raising.) The pension is a whole separate, complex issue. It is pretty uneven between rural people and urban people, between residents and migrants. Suffice it to say that for hundreds of millions of people, their pension is completely inadequate to live on. That’s why people are dependent on their children. But they only have one child. That child is paying the mortgage, but they can’t really support it. So the answer to making this shift is raising wages and increasing social protections. The policy prescription is really not complicated. But how to do it politically is extremely complicated. Even a man as confident in himself as Xi Jinping would have a hard time doing it. I think there’s also an ideological component to this. Based on what Xi and other leaders say, I think that they’re just a little bit neoliberal in this respect. Xi was very explicit. He was like, we don’t want to have excessively generous welfare policies to support lazy people. Despite the fact that it is a Communist Party, they just don’t see that as their job. In terms of real estate, it needs to be a less central part of the economy. You have to have a property tax so local governments can generate revenue to support all the welfare programs that we have just talked about. But again, the real estate companies don’t want it. They’re extremely powerful. And lots of otherwise sympathetic middle class people also don’t want it because Chinese people have a huge percentage of their wealth invested in real estate. They don’t have the same kind of options around equities and mutual funds that people and other wealthy countries have. And so they sink all their money into real estate. And for a long time, that was a really good deal. But if they sunk all their money into a house, and then all of a sudden it’s being taxed at whatever percent a year, they might not have the income to pay that in addition to everything else they need. So it’s politically very difficult. I don’t want to do too much mirror imaging here, but I have been struck several times by things you've said that seem to suggest similar vibes in China and in the U.S. For example, Jack Ma berating people for not working enough felt very Elon Musk-y to me. Or young people, either “lying flat” in China or “quiet quitting” here in the U.S. And then you just mentioned Xi’s admonition against welfare for lazy people, which really reminded me of Paul Ryan’s welfare “hammock.” It’s striking how similar these sentiments seem. I think there are a lot of similarities. Since you mentioned Elon Musk, he’s actually tried to use the Chinese example to break his American employees, to get them to burn the midnight oil. The reality of what was going on at Shanghai Tesla was that workers were put in the closed loop in the Tesla factory during the Shanghai lockdown. They went in being told that they might be there for a few days, and they ended up there for [eight weeks]. So that’s the model that appeals to guys like Elon Musk and Jack Ma. And I can tell you for a fact that the Chinese workers who were in there were not doing it because they’re more morally upright or more committed to increasing the wealth of the world’s wealthiest man. They just didn’t have a choice. I think we should commend Tesla employees in the United States for refusing to do that. Your broader point about the similarities—not just between the U.S. and China, but also between China and many other countries around the world—is really important because sometimes amidst all of the geopolitical strife, we imagine these two societies as fundamentally different. Actually, I think that a lot of the same global pressures are being brought to bear on both societies. A lot of the particulars are different: The expansion of higher education in China has been much more rapid; the social change and the generational difference in experience between people in their 60s versus people in their 20s is different for sure. I teach at a university that has lots of young people from the United States and from China. I think that the broader question—about how people can make a decent life for themselves given the structural conditions—is something that’s troubling to people in both places, and that is unfortunate. I wish it were grounds for solidarity between young people of our two great nations. I’m a bit hesitant to ask this question, because there is a tendency on this side of the world to frame everything in terms of, “Is this going to be the thing that brings down the CCP?” But a Bloomberg article earlier this month quoted a report from advisors to Xi’s which said that if they don’t get a handle on youth unemployment it could cause serious political problems. Do you think this is becoming a more salient issue for the government? What might the government do to mitigate the possibility of serious political problems or unrest, if it won’t alter the economic status quo? First of all, I think it’s a totally legitimate question to ask. What are the potential political consequences of this structural condition? I don’t think it spells the end of the Communist Party and I think that we shouldn’t speculate about that too much. But we should think through what those potential political effects are. As I’ve already said, after 1989, the central deal between the state and educated young people was that if they stay out of politics, they can expect regular material improvements in their lives. The Communist Party sees educated youth as one of their core constituencies that they really want to keep happy. Part of the reason for that is because of the Communist Party’s own history. They were founded by educated young people. Mao was working in the Peking University library. Deng Xiaoping had studied abroad in France. They’re keenly aware that dissatisfied educated young people can present a political challenge to the existing state. And so if that deal—political acquiescence in exchange for material improvement—is unraveling, then they’re going to have to find another way of handling this group of people. The tools that they have at their disposal are different for college graduates than they are for lots of other people in Chinese society who are dissatisfied. The Chinese state spends a lot of time thinking about risks to political stability. When it comes to Uyghurs, they have one set of tools, for overwhelming repression—camps, surveillance, all of that. They can’t use those tools on college graduates, for a whole variety of reasons. But there are other things they could do around the margins. They could certainly do something with respect to housing. A robust public housing program wouldn’t necessarily require a complete overhaul of the economy. They could keep some of that capacity around construction going and allow people to feel a little bit less anxious about making a life for themselves in the city. We’ve seen some housing programs here and there, but it continues to be very piecemeal. And overall, urban real estate continues to be very market-driven. The liquidation of the entire private tutoring industry—which is targeting young people before they graduate college—is an acknowledgment of sorts that young people in Chinese society feel like they’re under too much pressure, and they don’t want them to be going to all of these hours of tutoring. There have been efforts to restrict the amount of homework that schools can assign and to turn the temperature down a little bit on testing. All of that is an indicator that they’re interested in doing something to address some of these issues. Assuming that they’re not going to be able to enact deep structural reforms that would really resolve this problem, which I don’t think is very likely, the question then is, if there are a lot of people with grievances, what are the likely political consequences going to be? And I think that the political consequences will probably not be very serious. What will probably happen is that lots of people will suffer from depression and anxiety, and that what is a fundamentally social problem will be put on the backs of individuals to bear by themselves. Sounds familiar. Yeah, that’s true most of the time. As an educator, I see it very clearly, in rising rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems among young people. So I think that will largely be the extent of it. The avenues for political expression are pretty limited. You can’t join a political party, you can’t join a union, and you can’t form your own organization. There are online communities that pop up here and there, but if they get too big, they get censored and reined in. The state doesn’t have to use the kind of repression that they use against Uyghurs or Tibetans. They can use a more delicate form of oppression. But in terms of political consciousness, I do think that there has been a significant shift among highly educated youth in China. I’ve seen this among my students here, and I’ve definitely seen it in the writing that students back in China are doing. The clearest example of this was during the White Paper movement. The protests were not representative of youth in general; the total number of people who were actually out on the streets shouting, “Down with Xi Jinping!” was pretty small. So who’s to say what the majority of people are thinking. But the fact that it was even possible. . . I mean, saying “Down with Xi Jinping, down with the Communist Party” in public was unthinkable in October 2022, and in November 2022, it was happening all over the place, including here at Cornell, and in many places around the world. During private conversations with many people, I’ve seen folks who were previously quite patriotic and pro-government say, “Wow, if the government can just lock me in my apartment in Shanghai for months—me, a relatively privileged, well-educated person—what else could they do to me?” Also, the things the government has promised about a better life—trust the Communist Party and your livelihoods will improve—that’s not really panning out anymore. That has effected a change. Whether that actually eventually translates into action is another question. But it is now another problem for the state to manage, in a way that they haven’t had to manage, coming from what had been a pretty solid base of support for them for a few decades. The Tibetans, the Uyghurs, and Hong Kong were always troublesome for them. But here in the core, in Beijing, in Shanghai, and in the big cities, they have this other concern and so they’ll have to pay more attention to it.",

This display of work was well received by the audience and was followed by a rendition of Sinach- He Did it Again sung by 5 students of DCC Music studio for the processional of candidates. The opening prayer was delivered by Pastor Kathleen Richardson, followed by a rendition of the national anthem played on trombone by Kasem Thompson and accompanied by Devaunie Richardson. The national song was sung by Michealanne Benjamin and Shaumelle Hodge, accompanied by Khorey Barrett on piano. The opening remarks were presented by Michealanne Benjamin who established the protocol and introduced the chairperson, Ms. Lois Hazell. Ms. Hazell gave a brief overview of the CSEC Music program. She spoke about the SBA moderation exercise which requires students to perform one solo piece, scale and arpeggio and one ensemble piece graded both by music teacher and the moderator. She explained that weeks later a practical exam follows requiring candidates to perform their 2nd solo piece, scale and arpeggio and conduct a live performance of an original composition or an arrangement of a simple piece (e.g. a nursery rhyme) transcribed by candidates. During this practical exam candidates must also submit their Composition and Arrangement portfolio with full scores and audio recordings of their arrangement and composition. They must also complete a viva voce exercise with varied questions asked by examiner on scores in their performance portfolio which is a compilation of ensemble and solo pieces usually covered from 3rd to 5th form. Candidates also provide feedback as a storyline on their arrangement and composition. The highlight of the evening was the eight CSEC candidates performing solo and ensemble pieces of varied genres and conducting a live performance of their arrangement played by musicians which included past CSEC Music students, music teachers and civil servants. Those who played steelpan were accompanied by music teacher Casey Richardson. ZuJian Elvis Wu performed on French horn and double tenor steelpan, Aidin Richardson on piano and clarinet, Jelani Gumbs on alto saxophone and double tenor steelpan, Amiyah Carry on piano and recorder, Rayvia Hodge on piano and violin, Richard Grant on electric bass, Najique Davis Edwards on piano and electric bass and Khorey Barrett on piano and alto saxophone. All students delivered their renditions beautifully, with confidence and style. The appreciative audience appeared to enjoy the performances tremendously with smiles on their faces and in some cases rocking to the beats. Certificates of Appreciation were then distributed by owner of DCC Music studio Mrs. Daphne Jacobs Richardson and parent Mrs. Rochelle Grant. Mrs. Chanelle Petty Barrett, parent of one of the candidates, presented the Vote of Thanks. Special mention was made of Cordane Richardson, son of Corvette Richardson and Daphne Jacobs Richardson who offered a course in composition to candidates of DCC Music studio and to Daphne Jacobs Richardson, owner and tutor of DCC Music Studio for staging this recital. The program concluded with an ensemble performance of Canon in D by Pachabel presented by the eight candidates. They performed on keyboard, bass guitar, clarinet, French horn and different families of the well-known Baroque instrument -the recorder – namely descant alto, tenor and bass recorders. There were also a few MuseScore playbacks of candidates Arrangement and Compositions. The recital was well attended, and many persons spoke highly of the students’ performances. One person said, “I was thrilled and impressed by all the performances.” Others described it as, “an absolutely amazing experience,” “a really great evening,” “the variety and versatility was off the charts,” “it was indeed a classy event” and “a great job by students”. DCC Music Studio would like to thank all persons who attended the recital and for those who were unable but sent well wishes. When asked about the CSEC Music program Mrs. Jacobs Richardson commented, “It began in 2003 with the first group sitting their exams in 2005. This subject has quite a number of requirements to be fulfilled by candidates, which require proper planning and execution with dedication and commitment to tasks both by teacher and candidates. I encourage all to continue with an unwavering passion to promote music education in Anguilla.”",

      "title": "Artist Beverly Barkat Reimagines the Earth’s Trash as a Glittering Globe",
      "text": "In the window-walled lobby of New York’s 3 World Trade Center, Beverly Barkat’s blonde hair swung into her face as she leaned down to surreptitiously pick up a receipt lying on the floor, likely dropped by one of the many tourists, businesspeople or city dwellers streaming through the building. This has become second nature for the Israeli artist, who for three years collected scraps of public waste for her latest large-scale installation. Looming behind Barkat is the project: a 13-foot sphere of the globe glistening with 180 panels of what appears to be stained glass. But upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the sculpture’s main medium isn’t colorful glass at all, but a coating of epoxy resin gluing together waste plastic and fishing nets. Peering inside one of the sphere’s two empty window panels to look at its textured interior reveals the ugly truth. The earth’s colorful land masses, scatterings of islands and vast blue oceans are all made up of trash. “What we’re doing is covering ourselves in plastic waste,” Barkat told Observer. “It needs to feel suffocating.” The artist, who was commissioned to create a site-specific installation for the World Trade Center building in 2017, first came up with the idea for Earth Poetica while traveling between New York City, her home of Jerusalem, and Venice, where she was working on another exhibition at the time. On one of the many flights, she caught a documentary about the earth’s plastic waste problem. Its depiction of young children scavenging beaches for plastic to sell “was shocking” to Barkat, bringing back memories of her childhood in Johannesburg, South Africa, where she grew up collecting shells by the ocean before moving to Israel at age 10. “Wait a second, is this what we are giving to our children?” thought Barkat. “Is that what we’re leaving to the next generation?” An accumulation of waste sent in from around the world Armed with endless maps—including a flipped one, as Barkat worked on Earth Poetica from the inside out—she began the process of researching and creating the installation. The artist and her three daughters had been collecting plastic waste for the project while traveling until Covid hampered their efforts. But when word got out about Barkat’s work, strangers across the U.S., U.K., South Africa, Taiwan, Japan and Australia started mailing her materials. “Some people cleaned it before they sent it. Some of them didn’t,” noted Barkat with a laugh. Figuring out the proper resin to use was a trial and error process. The artist “tried all the resins in Israel” before moving on to North America, where she found a soy-based resin to cast the earth’s panels of waste. Holding up the sphere is a steel structure, complete with cables crisscrossing Earth Poetica’s hollow inside, alongside bamboo scaffolding to bring in an element of nature. “Each step was like a wrestling match,” said Barkat. Wrappers for San Benedetto water bottles and empty frozen green pea bags dot Earth Poetica’s smooth surface. But the mass of plastic waste isn’t dispersed according to its geographic origins. Pollution isn’t restricted by borders, according to Barkat. “You can find plastic waste in the ocean from all the different countries.” The oceans are a sea of crumpled blue plastic, with tiny pieces of waste scattered throughout, representing “plastic breaking up into these nano pieces that go into our food because fish are eating them,” said Barkat. She noted that five areas in the installation’s oceans contain pieces of fishing nets, where currents in real life gather particularly large collections of waste—60 percent of which are made up of nets. Trash posing as treasure Despite its heavy subject matter, the resin and trash of Earth Poetica create a beautiful, colorful stained glass effect, especially when light streams in through the windows of the building. This was purposeful, according to Barkat, who wanted to pull in passersby walking through the building. “It’s New York. Fashion, beauty, jewelry. It needed to be something like a jewel, a huge jewel.” The installation fittingly opened at the building on United Nations World Environment Day on June 5, after it was shown at the Gottesman Family Israel Aquarium in Jerusalem for nearly a year. Barkat, who runs a studio in Jerusalem, was born to two ceramicists. Despite protesting that she would never be an artist herself, she went on to study at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem and later worked on architectural interior projects. After raising her children, Barkat decided to embark on three years of study under renowned painter Israel Hirschberg. “At a certain time, I felt, okay, I really need to invest in my art,” she said. Married to Nir Barkat, the former mayor of Jerusalem and Israel’s current minister of economy and industry, she began working abroad when her husband entered politics to help separate the couple’s careers. “That’s why I went to London and Japan and Venice and Rome and America; I did something here,” she said. Barkat just returned from a trip to Wyoming’s Pryor Mountains to study wild horses for her next project, which will explore freedom and movement through oil paintings. Like Earth Poetica, the works will be on a large scale, which she favors because she finds the act of creating bigger pieces triggers a more unique artistic process. “The large works are more evolved than what my brain knows. if my own brain knows it, someone else has done it before.” And what of Earth Poetica? The installation will be on display at 3 World Trade Center until the fall. It may travel to Nairobi next, where the United Nations is hosting a summit on plastic waste, according to Barkat, who hopes the installation will eventually find a permanent home. “It came from waste. I don’t want it to go back to waste.”",

      "title": "‘My mother planned her own death for a long time. Why didn’t I believe her?’",
      "text": "This is what people say to you when you tell them that your mother has just died. Was it expected? Often, I said no. Sometimes, I said yes. Yes, it was expected. But not by me. My mother expected it. That’s not quite the right verb. She planned it. She planned her own death. And she told us to expect it, but I didn’t. Wasn’t I listening? Didn’t I believe her? I misjudged her. But would you have expected it? If you had met my mother in the last years of her life, when she was in her 70s, you would have been aware of her timidity. Although she had strong opinions, she moved uncertainly through the world. She was nervous of journeys. This timidity, in fact, often infuriated me. She was likely to panic when she had to pack for even a small and easy holiday, a straightforward there and back again. She would go over and over the possible missteps. Would she forget her passport? What shoes would she need? Would there be towels? For my mother, this anxiety around setting off on a journey had always been there, or if not always, then as long as I had known her. So how could I expect that she would set off on the longest journey, so decisively, alone? How could I expect that courage? I did not expect it. I did not expect my mother to kill herself. Yes, she told me. But for a long while, for the year leading up to her death, for the weeks leading up to her death, I kept my face turned away from the future, from the darkness, from the ending. After her death, I try to keep alive the last time I saw her, in an effort to keep her alive. If I don’t remember, if I start to forget, then she will really be gone. It was a Monday. I had taken a day off work, because of this crisis that seemed to be brewing with her. I was afraid of something, of her sadness, of her apparent decision to start cutting away from us. In fact, for a long time my mother had been saying, you know that when the time comes I will kill myself. But even when she said it, it never took shape to me as a definite possibility. My sister and I asked each other, what does she say to you? What do you think she means? My partner and I discussed it. She is lonely, he said. We talk almost every day! I said. That doesn’t mean she isn’t lonely. And when someone says something like that for years, and never does it, maybe you stop hearing it. Or you stop believing it. In fact, it seemed to be something that she said rather lightly, in the way that another mother might say, I won’t be around for ever you know. A tone that you associate with older women when their children and grandchildren seem to be taking them for granted, a tone to pull their relations back in and make them notice them again. A tone that doesn’t necessarily alert you to a crisis. A conversation that seems likely to continue, over and over again, and not come to a sudden end. So that wasn’t what frightened me. What frightened me was not the repetition of that old line, but the fact that she was behaving in strange, new ways. She gave away, one by one, pieces of family jewellery. And something else changed. She stopped making plans. She had always been the one who said in September, what are we doing at Christmas, the one who said in January, are we going to Walberswick this summer. But all of a sudden that stopped. In November, I asked her about arrangements for my daughter’s birthday in December, and she said she couldn’t plan for that. I asked her whether she wanted to go to the theatre over Christmas, and she said she didn’t want to make any arrangements. And then she sent an email inviting everyone in the immediate family to join her for lunch in a restaurant in Golders Green. It was not a birthday, it was not an anniversary. In the customs of our family, this was unusual, to go out all of a sudden for a restaurant lunch when there was no particular celebration. We all went along, as if it was normal. Ten of us around the table. My mother, my sister, me, and our partners and children. She gave each of us an envelope, for later. Later, we found in them kind cards and wodges of cash. What did she mean by that, I asked my sister. I have no idea, she said. And so she went on, scaring us and reassuring us. And then finally my sister went round to her flat one Sunday and confronted her, and asked her why she was being so odd, and she said, I think it is time. Then for a while we all tried to do this impossible thing, which is to try to tether someone to life when they are moving away, tying knots in the ropes of love and memory while they are just as busily untying them. On the second Monday in December, I took a day off work, and asked my mother out to lunch. I felt that I couldn’t wait till the weekend to see her, which is what we would usually do. So yes, I knew there was trouble. And no, I had no idea that this was our last lunch. I chose the restaurant. One of those urban, cavernous restaurants pitched at hipsters, serving Indian street food. It seemed perfect for my 75-year-old mother. She sat there in her plain shirt and jeans, her long white hair tied back, and seemed pleased with everything. After the meal, we walked along the canal. My mother is, was, one of those people who can be delighted and transfixed by the smallest pleasures. At the same moment that we were complaining about how the old King’s Cross had disappeared, we were also enjoying the new King’s Cross. We got a coffee in a chichi cafe next to the canal. It was strangely warm on that December day, in the afternoon sunshine. There were blankets laid out on the chairs, but we didn’t even need them. Our mood lightened. Swans passed by on the dirty water, ploughing their fine proud way. We talked about my children, about something funny that my son said the other day and about my daughter’s art project. Apparently apropos of nothing at all, she told me that if I ever needed it, the key to her locked cabinet was in the drawer of her bedside table. I looked away, at the swans. “You’re not listening to me,” she said. “No,” I agreed, in a light voice, “I’m not.” I didn’t want to hear this, why I might need that key. That little key, which she needed. So I went on talking about politics, memories, children. I could not imagine then that this would be our last lunch together. The last of those important unimportant conversations that had studded our five decades of conversations. It’s impossible to imagine the sound of silence. I left her at Euston station, waiting for her train back to Watford. Long white hair, pale grey anorak, reading the newspaper. Four days later my mother took her own life. The day itself, that’s a day that blurs in memory. It started for me at the Southbank Centre, where the refugee women I work with were presenting a drama performance to a small, invited audience at lunchtime. We gathered in the morning to rehearse. I know that I was there. I know that all morning women came and went in the studio, carrying chairs, putting out drinks, repeating lines, getting dressed. But if I look into the memory, if I try to catch an image, a phrase, it is as though someone has tipped black ink into it. The ink spreads. I can see nothing. Not a face, not a colour, not an image. I can hear nothing. The ink is spreading out from the messages I was sending all morning to my mother, and when she did not respond, to my sister. My sister lives just around the corner from my mother. At first we dismissed the fact that our texts to my mother were going unanswered. And then we allowed our fears to surface, and my sister walked round to see how she was. And then she rang me, to tell me that the curtains were drawn in my mother’s flat and she was not answering the doorbell. The ink floods. The darkness spreads. And then I’m running through Euston station to get on a train to Watford. Images come back, with an edge of coldness. A very polite policeman in my sister’s sitting room. A small glass of sherry, so old-fashioned, in my hands. A letter, typewritten, rather formal. The weight of my daughter’s head on my shoulder as she cries. No image of my mother, though. Because that view of her at Euston station – white hair, grey jacket, reading the newspaper – that one had become final. We did not go into her flat the day that she died. We could only imagine it, from what the policeman said. It was peaceful. She was in bed. Later, we could construct what she had done. Later, we learned that she had ordered the poison on the internet years before. That she had kept the bottle until the time was right. That she had gone to bed with a drink, with the poison, and with a picture of her grandchildren beside her, for a last look. Later. But not now. The police brought us the farewell letter they had found on the bedside table. So although she was no longer there to speak to us, her words reverberated. And yet the letter seemed strangely impersonal. It seemed to be written for an audience that was not precisely us. The day afterwards, we went into the empty flat. And then I remembered what I had not heard at the time, and told my sister where the key to the locked cabinet was. We opened it, and found a book, The Peaceful Pill Handbook, published by Exit International, and here were two letters to us. These letters were more personal, perhaps. But we both could only glance at them in a sideways manner, as though the charge they held was too dangerous to detonate. I put mine in my bag, and vowed to read it properly soon, soon. My mother had been preparing for her death for a long time, and so it was hard not to find significance in everything that she had left in her flat. She had, for instance, left biscuits and fruit on the table and soup in the fridge. “She left them for us to eat while we were doing this,” said my sister, as we sat in the flat in the first days after her death. We were already trying to take those steps that you have to take, in the aftermath of a death – steps to tell the authorities, to speak to the police, to the hospital, to the coroner, to the banks, to the neighbours. As we picked up, here and there, in her flat, the things we needed in those first days, we found the letter she had wanted us to send to all of her friends. It was short and succinct. Hi I am writing this, for my daughters to send, to let you know that I have killed myself. I always wanted to, when I felt it was the right time, when I could make my own choice. I decided to do so this year whilst I am still happy but very aware of my failing memory and health. I have been a member, on and off, of various societies such as the Euthanasia Society and currently Dignity for Dying, and so this probably comes as no surprise. Politically I think all people should be able to make this choice without it being illegal and so difficult. Please be happy for me to have successfully achieved what I wanted to. I have been so lucky in having you as a friend. I wish I could have said all this to you personally but the law does not allow for that, so this will have to do. I hope the rest of your years will be happy and stress free, with deep affection from Ruth Alongside the letter was a list of all those she wanted to receive it. My sister and I talked about how to begin. You can’t just email a farewell letter, we felt. There is something about that that feels too heartless, sending out such a message into the indifferent ether of the internet, to land with someone at some unexpected point in their lives and their day. Particularly these people, so many of them elderly, so many of them alone. So we started to telephone people and tell them what we were sending them. It took us a long time, many days, because every time we had to say why we were telephoning we had to hold ourselves together very hard, and the effort was too exhausting to make more than one or two phone calls each day. One of the first people I telephoned was one of my mother’s oldest friends, Heather Strange. They had met in the peace movement in London in the 60s, but now Heather lived alone on the wild Welsh coast. I had not seen Heather since I was 16. Everything had changed. But voices do not change, and Heather’s voice was still the same slow and thoughtful voice that I remembered from that warm summer when I thought she held some secret to happiness there in her self-built house on her little smallholding. I told her what I had to tell her, and waited for her shock and tears. Instead, I heard her calmness. Heather was not surprised. She was sad, but she was not shocked. Apparently my mother had talked to her about her determination to take this path when she began to feel the first signs of dementia. Heather had not done what I had done – averted my eyes and ignored what I heard – when she had told her. Ruth had been planning this for a long time, she reminded me, and she asked me why I thought that she had decided to go now, at a time that might seem premature, but must have seemed right for her. Her knowledge and acceptance startled me. And it made me think again about what I had done and what I had been to my mother. While her friends had accepted her decision, I had turned my gaze away. I had thought I was holding my mother in the land of the living, by talking about the children and the menu on that last lunch, by refusing to listen when she told me where her keys were. But I had been shutting my eyes to the reality, to her reality. I had been in denial, as one says, as though denial were a place rather than an action. Maybe denial was a place, a place where I had stopped, unable to move forwards. In that place called denial, I had assumed that at the end of the day my mother would do the conventional thing. That she would go on living, until forced out of life by a failing body. But she was not conventional in that way. She was unpredictable. She acted by her own rules, not those of others. She decided on her own way. I had misjudged her so terribly. During the dark days and months that followed I felt that I was flailing around, trying to understand myself, trying to understand her. I had failed her, I thought again and again. Grief is so much heavier than one expects. That’s what everyone tells you. God, yes, it’s true, the exhaustion, the weight of it. But in my grief, there was also guilt, and the dragging weight of that guilt pulled me down and down. I had chosen to live in denial, and in so doing I had failed my mother. So many of us who have experienced the death of a parent know what this feels like: walking into their home, laying hands on their things, and starting the awful business of sorting out and clearing away. So intrusive and intimate and curiously premature, however long you leave it. But eventually, it has to be done. As clear as it is that my mother had tried to sort all her things out before she died, it is also clear that she didn’t really manage it. She had always been a spectacularly untidy person, and the struggle to be otherwise, to tidy up the stuff of life before she left it for good, was not successful. In her little study there are cardboard boxes full of folders of papers, envelopes and photo albums, in random and overlapping categories with miscellaneous bits and pieces thrown through them. Much as my sister and I would like to dive straight through the task ahead of us, we are constantly distracted by memories that eddy around us. Certain photographs are taken out, looked at, left on tables, taken to our homes, put on mantelpieces, stacked into other boxes or albums. And as we look at the pictures, we take random steps back through time. There is the grandmother with long white hair, smiling, a child on her lap. A step backwards. There is the middle-aged woman squinting into the sunshine in Cyprus with her boyfriend. Another step. The mother who is younger than I am now, newly divorced, with her teenage daughters in Italy. Another step. A woman who looks much too young to be a mother, in a sunlit daze in a seaside garden, with two little girls making daisy chains. And then a tumble that takes me out of the time that makes sense, into the years before I was part of my parents’ lives. Here is a young woman, thick dark hair cut in a bob, the same open smile, a cigarette between her fingers, in an office alongside a couple of young men. Here are love letters addressed to a disused name, Ruth Oppenheim. Here is a scruffy brown envelope, unmarked. Out of it flutters a frayed paper. “You, Ruth Oppenheim, are charged with the offence shown below. On the 29th day of April 1961, at Whitehall SW1, having been made acquainted with the Directions of the Commissioner of the Metropolis... did wilfully disregard the said directions.” The paper records my mother’s first arrest for civil disobedience, when she was just 19. I knew Ruth was a committed participant in the movement against nuclear weapons. But here is evidence of an arrest that I had entirely forgotten about – if she ever told me about it – which has been carefully kept for over 50 years along with other records of arrests, fines and court hearings. At the time, I put it back in its envelope with the other papers that track this illegal activity, and back in the box with old flyers and pamphlets and newspaper cuttings of demonstrations. The box comes home with me, alongside other bits and pieces, and months later I take it out and look up what happened on this date. I read that the demonstration of 29 April 1961 was described at the time as the largest outbreak of civil disobedience seen in the UK since the suffragette movement. It was organised by the Committee of 100, the most radical organisation of the nuclear disarmament movement of the 1960s. The march had been banned in advance. Despite this, Ruth Oppenheim and around 2,500 others walked silently down Whitehall and sat down in Parliament Square. There were more than 800 arrests, and alongside my mother in the police vans that evening were some of the more celebrated supporters of the disarmament movement, such as Vanessa Redgrave, who was herself only 24. Perhaps we are accustomed now to seeing young people walking through London with their banners, ready to be arrested for their principles. Then, less so. The whole event, happening as it did before the 60s had got under way, caused consternation and condemnation as well as sympathy. But not at all put off by the experience, Ruth was to go on and be arrested time and again – and to move into more dangerous illegal action of other kinds. She was not, then, always the timid person that I remember. She was not, then, always the woman who was nervous about going to new places, who needed endless instructions before trying new things. No, she was happy to “wilfully disregard” authority, and take the consequences. How have I forgotten that she was also this person? As I look through her papers I find more and more of that woman. Her image. Her voice. Here are other photographs from the same years; this same young woman sitting in front of policemen at the entry to an underground bunker. And again here, the young woman in low-heeled sandals and a knee-length skirt, watching as a man is dragged away by police at another demonstration. Here is a small portrait photograph, of that young woman with her thick black hair and direct gaze, and this one has a little Post-it note stuck to it: “When breaking the law!” As I go on looking at these photographs, this woman begins to take up more room in my mind. She wasn’t brought up to do this. For some reason I find that very important. I feel that the reasons for being politically active are becoming so elusive for me right now. Whether that is for personal reasons – that I am just too tired and sad – or for political reasons – that the world is darkening so much that activism feels pointless – I feel completely overwhelmed when I consider becoming politically active again. So when I think about how my mother first became not only politically engaged, but actually ready to break the law on many occasions, I am struck by how much it took for her to push her way out of her family pressures in order to make her way on to that street in 1961 where she was first arrested. The pressures came particularly from her father, who hid his own private history of rebellion and resistance in 1930s Germany from her. And from her mother, who was still grieving the loss of her own family in the Holocaust. Perhaps it was unsurprising, given their history, that all Ruth’s parents wanted was for their children to fit in, to be careful, to be quiet. But none of that made sense to Ruth. She was not going to live in silence. Like so many young women in the 1960s, she was going to find new ways to live and to love. As I follow her back through the years, I begin to understand more and more not just the manner of her death, but also, more vitally, the manner of her life. And so my grief does not immediately lighten or pass, but it changes. And I change with it.

      "title": "How a Pinochet ‘death flight’ helicopter became UK gamepark prop",
      "text": "Ana Becerra Arce stands in a clearing at the site of a former detention and death camp in central Chile where she was held prisoner in 1975. “This was where the helicopters took off,” she says, pointing to the outlines of a now-overgrown landing pad. The spot – remote but just meters from the sands of Santo Domingo beach – was ideal for General Augusto Pinochet’s secret police to discretely board prisoners on to their fleet of Puma helicopters before flying out over the sea, and casting them – still alive – into the water. Such “death flights” were part of a campaign to forcibly disappear political dissidents, carried by military dictatorships in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. Officers would often drug or beat victims before throwing from aircraft into lakes, rivers and seas. But attempts to bring a prosecution for Chile’s very first such flight foundered as investigators never had access to a key piece of evidence: the helicopter involved was sold by the military in 2003 and shipped to the UK. Today, its rusting fuselage currently sits in the pine forests of Horsham, Sussex, where, in a bizarre and gruesome twist, it now serves as a prop in an airsoft park. Families of the disappeared expressed revulsion on hearing that the aircraft where their relatives lived their last moments was now being used for recreation and called for it be returned to Chile as a monument to Pinochet’s victims. “That helicopter is stained with blood,” said Gaby Rivera, president of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared (AFDD). “Of course it should not be in an amusement park.” Chile’s first known death flight took place in October 1973, a month into Pinochet’s 17-year dictatorship. Three of Becerra Arce’s political comrades – Luis Fernando Norambuena Fernandois, Gustavo Manuel Farías Vargas and Ceferino del Carmen Santis Quijada – were forced on to a Puma with the registration H-255, bound to a length of metal railing and then, 20 minutes later, thrown into the Pacific Ocean. In 2001, the Chilean army admitted to killing more than 100 people with the same method during Pinochet’s rule. But efforts to identify victims and perpetrators have been hamstrung by the armed force’s lacklustre co-operation. It was only in 2018 that a former brigadier and three pilots were officially named as suspects for the forced disappearance of the three men But the case remains open as investigators never had access to a key piece of evidence: H-255. Stripped of its electronics, wings and blades, the helicopter’s empty hulk is the centrepiece of a game called “Heli Domination” at the Dogtag Airsoft park, where participants use low-power airguns to simulate combat. “There’s a massive Heli in the middle, whoever can touch [it for] the most amount of time will be the winner,” says a staff member in a video filmed earlier this year. An online review for the park enthuses: “Any site where you legitimately say ‘get to da choppa’ is on to a winner.” Rivera said that Chile’s army should have made the helicopter available to investigators, and called on officials to finally supply the names of all those who were thrown into the sea. “We demand the total truth and full justice,” she said. Sebastián Velásquez, who represents the families of Norambuena and Gustavo Farías Vargas, said that a vital piece of evidence like H-255 never should have left Chile. Velásquez, a lawyer at the memory and justice organisation Londres 38, said that while the army systematically destroyed evidence relating to dictatorship-era crimes, H-255 remained intact until 2003. But it was hastily sold around the time of the first state-led investigations into the dictatorship’s crimes, which, Velasquéz said, “is cause for suspicion”. He called on the Chilean government to bring the helicopter home to “serve as a memorial of the horror”.UK-based publication Helicopter International reported that H-255 was purchased by the British company Askari Aeroparts around 2003. It “made a couple of appearances in 2005 at local air shows” but was subsequently broken up for spare parts. Dogtag Airsoft owner Ross Beare said he was unaware of the Puma’s dark past until he was contacted by the Guardian. “I took delivery of the dismantled aircraft in November 2014. It was just the empty fuselage and tail shell,” he said. Beare said he “simply knew it was in the Chilean air force” and that the helicopter is “now looking rather sorry for itself” after being in the woodland for almost a decade. “I’m not sure I shall be able to look at it in the same way again or how I will feel when my young son wants to sit in it and given now I know its history,” he said in an email. Chile has been slow to recognise the brutality of the Pinochet era, unlike neighbouring Argentina, which has taken decisive steps to condemn those responsible for crimes against humanity during its 1976-83 military dictatorship. In June, a former Argentine “death flight” plane was returned from the USA to Argentina to be displayed in the Buenos Aires Museum of Memory. The plane, Skyvan PA-51, was located in the USA with its flight log intact, a vital piece of evidence that led to the conviction of three pilots. But the possibility of prosecuting those guilty of the atrocities committed on H-255 appear increasingly distant. With the helicopter reduced to a weathered shell, many clues have been erased. The flight log has never been located. In 2018, Emilio Robert De La Mahotiere González, accused of piloting the first H-255 death flight, was charged for 20 years for participating in several other execution campaigns during the Pinochet regime. He served only three years in a comfortable prison facility, and is carrying out the rest of his 20-year sentence under house arrest. His daughter, Chantal Robert de la Mahotiere, is a rightwing politician who unsuccessfully ran for election to write Chile’s new constitution earlier this year and has lobbied to scrap convictions against Pinochet-era officials. Becerra Arce said the helicopter should be erected in front of La Moneda, Chile’s presidential palace as a memorial to the democratically elected government which Pinochet helped topple. Standing at the former heliport, she recalled Luis Fernando, Gustavo and Ceferino – the three men who were forced onto H-255. She knew them personally; one had even visited her house. She last saw them in a prison camp, where they waved to one another from a distance. “Then one day they were taken and they didn’t come back.”",

      "title": "‘They abuse us’: Workers making Fifa World Cup merchandise face harm, says report",
      "text": "Female workers who produce Fifa merchandise for events such as the Women’s World Cup have endured pay below minimum wage, verbal abuse, unpaid overtime and threats of job loss if they fall pregnant, according to a new report by human rights researcher Equidem. Equidem has criticised Fifa for not taking action on a situation that seems to go against the advances the tournament has been responsible for, and president Gianni Infantino has been urged to extend “that progress to addressing the harms its women workers experience”. Equidem has put its report into the context of the litany of migrant labour abuses that occurred due to the men’s World Cup in Qatar and asked why there has been no update from a human rights subcommittee that was supposed to be set up to assess the legacy of that event, raising questions about Fifa’s expressed commitment to improving working conditions. The report features interviews with women workers in factories in Bangladesh that make official merchandise for Fifa events, and involves distressing testimonies including verbal abuse and the illegal denial of worksite childcare and maternity leave. Equidem heard several stories of women denied freedom of association. “We have a daily target to reach,” one worker said. “The supervisor fixes our daily target. I make 60-80 pieces per hour. I can only go to the restroom after finishing my hourly target. When a lot of work piles up, they don’t let us go anywhere. They verbally abuse us. I work for 10-12 hours a day at my sewing machine. Today, my supervisor told me to give 80 pieces per hour, but it was quite difficult to make 80 pieces. I made 60 pieces per hour. He shouted at me several times. “I can’t keep my son with me. I work between eight and 12 hours every day. Who will look after him? I searched for someone to leave my son with when I went to work, but I did not get anyone. We don’t have a childcare room in our factory. My son lives in Dhaka with my mother-in law and father-in-law.” Workers described a common practice of being told they would lose their jobs if they became pregnant during the first two years of employment. One woman employed as a sewing machine operator explained: “When I started working here, the factory doctor told me not to have babies for the first two years. I was told that after completing two years, I can have children. If I get pregnant before that, I will have to resign. They will not give me any leave.” Some workers spoken to by Equidem reported that they did not get paid any maternity leave at all, even though they are supposed to be legally entitled to four months, making it a clear violation of Bangladeshi law. Equidem’s CEO Mustafa Qadri states: “After the Men’s World Cup this past year in Qatar, FIFA pledged to set up a human rights subcommittee that would assess the legacy of the 2022 tournament, although there has been no further update as to the status of that assessment, nor its learnings. Equidem urges FIFA to extend its expressed commitment to improving working conditions to women workers in their apparel supply chains. \"Yet, the world has seen significant advances in pay parity for women players, including making the Women’s World Cup more professional, ensuring equal regulations and conditions, and fair distribution of prize money to players. The United States team, after years of negotiations, public battles, and court filing won an equal pay deal that makes them one of the best-paid national teams in the world. \"The FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 brings with it many positive improvements for its players, and it is crucial that FIFA extends that progress to addressing the harms its women workers experience. FIFA has the power, money, and resource to address this at the systemic level, and we will keep monitoring their global supply chains until it does. “This movement toward gender parity within FIFA, signals a heightened commitment within the organisation to fair conditions for women players—on par with their male counterparts. This should extend to all women, not just those under the stadium lights.” A Fifa spokesperson said: “FIFA has stringent labour rights requirements for companies producing FIFA-licensed goods and takes any allegation of labour rights abuse in its supply chain very seriously. FIFA is in contact with both Equidem and the respective companies to further investigate the matter.”",

      "title": "The most audacious art heists in history: From Mona Lisa stolen by worker who simply lifted it off...",
      "text": "Throughout history people have attempted and succeeded in stealing priceless pieces and precious artefacts from museums. Some of the most audacious heists include the Mona Lisa being stolen by a worker who simply lifted it off the wall, in addition to the thieves of an Edvard Munch leaving a note which read: 'Thank you for the poor security'. More recently it was revealed a worker who was a 'world expert' was sacked by British Museum after items were 'missing, stolen or damaged'. Peter John Higgins, 56, had worked at the museum for 30 years before he was accused of theft. Going back to 1911, while working at the Louvre in Paris, Vincenzo Peruggia walked up to the painting, took it off the wall, extracted it from its case, and took the Mona Lisa home. Vincenzo Peruggia who worked at the Louvre, Paris walked up to the painting, took it off the wall, extracted it from its case, and took the Mona Lisa home Francisco Goya’s portrait of The Duke of Wellington was stolen from London's National Gallery by Kempton Bunton Despite its simplicity, 112 years later it is still one of the most-well known art heists in history. Peruggia kept the painting hidden in a trunk for two years before getting caught trying to sell it to a gallery in Florence - he said he wanted to return it to its homeland. The Mona Lisa was returned to the Louvre, but in the meantime police had accused a number of people of theft, including Pablo Picasso. Fifty years later, on the same date as the Mona Lisa theft, Francisco Goya’s portrait of The Duke of Wellington was stolen from London's National Gallery by Kempton Bunton. The Duke which was released in 2020 starring Jim Broadbent and Helen Mirren depicts the heist which saw Kempton steal the painting to raise £140,000 for a cause close to his heart - ensuring elderly and poor people could get free TV licences. Four years after Bunton climbed through a bathroom window - which he had previously left ajar - he turned up at a police station and confessed to the theft. Bunton's lawyer Jeremy Hutchinson QC, managed to persuade the jury that his client had borrowed the painting and he was only convicted of stealing the frame. In 1994, two men used a ladder to break in to Oslo's National Gallery and take Edvard Munch's Scream painting. They subsequently left a note which said: 'Thank you for the poor security.' The British Museum worker sacked over missing priceless treasures was today named as Peter John Higgs, 56, The Duke which was released in 2020 starring Jim Broadbent (left) and Helen Mirren (right) depicts the heist which saw Kempton steal the painting to raise £140,000 for a cause close to his heart - ensuring elderly and poor people could get free TV licences Two men used a ladder to break in to Oslo's National Gallery and take Edvard Munch's Scream painting - of which there was four versions. [Stock Image] The museum refused to pay a ransom charge of $1 million, but the painting was later recovered. A decade later a different version of Munch's Scream - there were four versions created by the artist in total - was stolen from the same gallery by masked gunmen in broad daylight. Several of the thieves were convicted but it wasn't until two years later the police managed to recover the painting. Dubbed the biggest art heist in modern history, five men have been convicted of orchestrating and carrying out the theft of 18th-century jewels worth £100 million from a Dresden museum in 2019. The Dresden state court ruled that the five men aged 24 to 29 were responsible for the break-in at the eastern German city's Green Vault Museum on November 25, 2019, and the theft of 21 pieces of jewellery containing more than 4,300 diamonds with a total insured value of at least 113.8 million euros (£99 million). The theft included 21 pieces of jewellery containing more than 4,300 diamonds with a total insured value of at least 113.8 million euros (£99 million) The Dresden state court ruled that the five men aged 24 to 29 were responsible for the break-in at the eastern German city's Green Vault Museum on November 25, 2019 Many of the pieces were badly damaged and some are still missing, including a brooch that belonged to Queen Amalie Auguste of Saxony. About 40 people are believed to have been involved in planning the heist and are still wanted. Furthermore, the five men cannot be forced to give any testimony on the whereabouts of the treasures, even though they have been convicted. In March 2020, three historic paintings dating back to the sixteenth century and thought to be worth millions of pounds vanished from an art gallery after an overnight heist. The alarm was raised when thieves broke into the renowned Christ Church Picture Gallery, in Oxford at 11pm. Dubbed the biggest art heist in modern history, five men have been convicted of orchestrating and carrying out the theft of 18th-century jewels worth £100 million from a Dresden museum in 2019 Described as 'one of the gravest art thefts ever' by an art expert, in 2015 bandits dressed in black entered the 14th century fortress at closing time and took paintings including masterpieces by Tintoretto, Rubens and Bellini. The men made their escape from Castelvecchio Museum in the security guard's car before switching to another vehicle. The bandits tied up and gagged the site's security officer and a cashier with one of the men watching over the hostages while the other two raided the exhibition rooms. At the time, Roberto Bolis, Verona council spokesman said the museum had 24-hour security but the robbery had been planned so that the thieves arrived after the building emptied but before the alarms had been activated.",

      "title": "Yotam Ottolenghi’s recipes for cooking with summer stone fruit",
      "text": "I love cooking with stone fruit: it’s so versatile, and as happy to keep its shape (brushed with oil and chargrilled, for example) as it is to be taken to the point of collapse in a hot pan. Either way, its natural sweetness is ready to be dialled right up and used in all sorts of chutneys and dressings. Chutneys, especially, being so sweet, tend to keep well, too, so make more than you need to have to hand for a few meals ahead. Grilled nectarine and cucumber salad with gochujang dressing (pictured top) This sweet and spicy dressing is a perfect match for grilled nectarines and cucumbers. The dressing is inspired by ssamjang, a Korean dipping sauce that’s often served with grilled meat. It can be made ahead and will keep for up to a week in the fridge, ready to be spooned over roast vegetables or stirred through noodles. Prep 10 minCook 20 minServes 4 as a side 1 cucumber, peeled, cut in half lengthways, then cut into 4-5cm chunksFine sea salt2 tbsp gochujang (Korean chilli paste)4 tsp soy sauce1 tsp caster (or granulated) sugar1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed4 tsp toasted sesame seeds¼ tsp sesame oil60ml olive oil1 lime, juiced, to get 1 tbsp, plus 1 wedge extra to serve3 nectarines or peaches, stoned and cut into quarters1 stick celery, trimmed, peeled with a peeler, then very finely sliced 1 spring onion, trimmed and finely sliced5g mint leaves, roughly torn Put the cucumber in a sieve, sprinkle over a half-teaspoon of salt, toss to coat and set over a bowl. For the dressing, put the gochujang, soy, sugar, garlic, three and a half teaspoons of the sesame seeds, sesame oil, two tablespoons of olive oil, lime juice and two nectarine quarters in a small food processor, blend for two minutes, to make a smooth paste, then transfer to a small bowl. Put a griddle pan on a high heat. Rub the remaining nectarine quarters all over with a tablespoon of olive oil, then grill for a minute on each cut side, until they get nice char marks. Transfer the cooked fruit to the bowl of gochujang dressing. Discard any liquid that has drained out of the cucumbers, then toss them with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Grill the cucumber pieces for a minute on each side, transfer to a bowl and leave to cool. Once cool, mix in the celery, spring onions and half the mint. To assemble the salad, put the dressed nectarines on a serving plate, then top with the cucumber mixture. Drizzle over the remaining dressing, scatter on the remaining half-teaspoon of sesame seeds and the mint, and serve with the lime alongside. Spiced pork chops with quick apricot chutney This chutney keeps well in the fridge for up to a week, and pairs very well with all sorts: other fatty meat, such as duck, say, or really mature cheddar. The tarka lends it extra flavour and flourish. If you can’t find fresh curry leaves, the dish works well without them, too. Serve with plain rice or flatbreads. Prep 10 minCook 30 minServes 4 4 x 350g thick-cut, bone-out pork chops, rind removed but fat left on1 tbsp hot madras curry powderFine sea salt and black pepper For the tarka60ml olive oil10 fresh curry leaves (optional)1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp black mustard seeds1 cinnamon stick1 tsp aleppo chilli, or ½ tsp regular chilli flakes For the chutney 1 red onion (150g), peeled, ½ finely chopped, the rest thinly sliced20g ginger, peeled and finely chopped1 mild green chilli (10g), halved, deseeded and finely sliced6 apricots (210g), halved and stoned2 tbsp caster sugar, plus a pinch extra for pickling25ml apple or regular cider vinegar To serve 10g coriander, leaves and stalks, roughly chopped60g plain yoghurt, thinned with 1 tbsp water Put the chops on a large plate, rub the curry powder all over both sides, then do the same with a teaspoon of salt and set aside to marinate. Next, make the tarka. Put three tablespoons of oil in a medium saucepan for which you have a lid, and set it over a medium heat. Add the curry leaves (if using), cumin, mustard seeds and cinnamon, and cook for one to two minutes, until the mustard seeds start to pop and the curry leaves turn dark green. Meanwhile, put the aleppo chilli in a small heatproof bowl. Take the pan off the heat, carefully pour a tablespoon and a half of the oil and spice mix over the aleppo chilli, then set the bowl to one side. Return the pan to the heat, stir in the chopped red onion, ginger, half the green chilli, the apricot halves and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, for five minutes, until the onions are soft and translucent. Stir in the sugar, 20ml vinegar, a quarter-teaspoon of salt, a good grind of pepper and two tablespoons of water, then cover and cook on a medium-high heat for 12 minutes, until the apricots start to break down. Take the pan off the heat and set aside. While the apricots are cooking, in a small bowl mix the sliced red onion with the rest of the green chilli, the remaining teaspoon of vinegar and the coriander, add a pinch each of salt and sugar, then set aside. Put a large frying pan on a high heat. Using tongs, hold the pork chops fat side down and upright in the hot pan and cook for two to three minutes, until the fat renders and forms a golden-brown crust (cook the pork in two batches, if need be). Lay the chops down on one side, add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan and leave to cook for three to four minutes, until the underside is deeply golden and slightly firm to touch. Turn the chops and cook on the other side for a minute or so more, until just sealed and golden. The meat should be firm to touch but dimple slightly when pressed. Once cooked, transfer the chops to a plate or tray and leave to rest for five minutes. When ready to serve, carve the chops widthways into 3cm-thick slices and lightly season each slice with a pinch of salt. Transfer to individual plates and spoon some of the chutney over the sliced pork. Dollop the yoghurt on top, spoon some tarka over the yoghurt and serve with the sliced onion mixture on the side. Roast beetroot with plum dressing and blue cheese This dramatic-looking dish makes great use of plums as a dressing, which is inspired by the Georgian dressing tkemali. Make extra, if you like, and serve with duck and other fatty meat, or with cheese. Feta would work as a substitute for the blue cheese, if need be. Prep 25 minCook 35 minServes 2-4 as a side 500g beetroot, trimmed and cut into 3cm-thick wedges 1½ tsp maple syrup 1 tbsp olive oil Salt and black pepper 20g toasted skinless hazelnuts, roughly chopped ¾ tbsp picked dill, roughly chopped30g soft blue cheese, crumbled – we used Saint Agur For the plum dressing 2 tsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 3-4 plums (250g), peeled, cut into quarters, then each quarter cut in half 1 tsp maple syrup¼-½ tsp regular chilli flakes, to taste1 tsp fennel seeds, toasted and roughly ground Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Put the beetroot, maple syrup, olive oil and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt in a medium bowl, toss to coat, then transfer to an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper. Bake for 25-30 minutes, stirring once halfway, until tender and slightly sticky. To make the dressing, put the oil in a medium pan on a medium heat and, when it’s hot, add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the plums, maple syrup, chilli, half the fennel seeds, a good grind of pepper and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Cook gently for five minutes, until the plums release their juices and soften, but still hold their shape. Take off the heat and, using a small spoon, lift out and set aside the larger pieces of plum. Keep the smaller, softer pieces in the pan, along with all the juices, then stir in the roast beetroot to coat. Spoon the dressed beetroot mix into a shallow bowl, then top with the reserved larger plum pieces. Scatter over the remaining fennel seeds, the hazelnuts and the dill, and serve with the cheese dotted around and about the top.",

      "title": "Haj Diaries: When The Call Comes",
      "text": "My sister and I first visited Saudi Arabia when we were six and seven years old, respectively. My parents were performing their Umrah in Makkah at the time. We landed in Jeddah, a grey and not so inviting city. If memory serves me, I remember driving somewhere (probably Makkah), but I have little memory of the city itself. It was not a modern or glitzy cityscape, nor did it have any high rises that one tends to associate with Gulf countries today. I vaguely remember touching the Ka’aba’s wall. My memory keeps bringing up the vivid coolness of the holy waters from the Aab-e-Zam Zam spring while my mother ritualistically ran between the Safa and Marva hills. I also recall feeling abandoned while she performed this ritual. Why was my mother running away from me? I thought. Those were the thoughts of the juvenile I was then. Many decades later, in 2023, I embarked on my first Umrah pilgrimage with a friend. The trip included a Ziarat of Damascus, where I paid my respects at Bibi Zainab’s tomb. And a few weeks ago, I ventured there for a second time as I also completed my Haj. “How was it, Hajan bibi?” everyone asks. In sincerity, this is not an easy question to answer. READ MORE: Of The Pilgrim And The Heart Awakened The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recently allowed single women to visit and perform religious pilgrimages at Makkah Mukarma and Madina Sharif, without the precondition of having a male Mehram. It naturally opened the gates for half of the world’s Muslim population to finally visit the holiest of places on their terms. Visiting the Beloved Makkah is the designated home of the Beloved. In the Holy Quran, the Beloved informs us that He is everywhere, closer to us than our jugular vein. Still, understanding human nature and our sense of community, he asks us to come to Makkah and pay homage at the Khaana-e-Ka’aba. Moving in concentric circles also represents combining the reality on Earth, our lives as we know it, with the eternal truth of the afterlife. The circling is a symbol of consciousness of living in this unity The Ka’aba has been a place of worship well before the message of Islam was revealed and a place of pilgrimage since Adam (AS). Visiting Makkah and performing specific rituals is one of the five critical pillars of Islam. Any Muslim who is able in mind and body for the rigours, and can afford the journey, is enjoined to undertake this pilgrimage. The city, towards which over a billion souls turn daily, is located in the province of Hejaz in western Saudi Arabia. I have never really thought about this city as anything but the home of the Khaana-e-Ka’aba. But it does mean that it has also never occupied much space in my mind. But having visited the city twice in the short span of three months and spent time with one’s heart, seeing with all my senses, it is truly a very special corner of mother Earth. My curiosity to learn its history has been piqued. The fifth pillar Islam, the religion of peace and service, is a very simple creed. The Haj is one of (the five) ordained pillars for Muslims. It is a pilgrimage (reenacting) in the footsteps of Prophet Mohammad (Peace Be Upon Him), who completed the Haj once in his life (towards the end of his life on Earth). It is a pilgrimage which includes many traditions in worshipping and remembering the Creator of our universe. The rituals and traditions of the Haj pilgrimage include some which date to pre-Islamic times. Circumambulating counterclockwise around the Ka’aba is a ritual which predates the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). But circling seven times is a Muslim tradition based on Islamic philosophy and the Prophet’s (PBUH) example (sunnat). The Ka’aba represents Islam’s central idea of ‘Oneness’. This idea is central to all monotheistic spiritual traditions – “Tawhid“. Moving in concentric circles also represents combining the reality on Earth, our lives as we know it, with the eternal truth of the afterlife. The circling is a symbol of consciousness of living in this unity. Seven represents the belief that there are seven layers or steps of attaining the truth. There is a belief in Islamic spiritualism that there are seven aspects to our essential self/soul. Each turn around the Ka’aba represents a phase, a stage in our existence. I understand this as our ego realises its essential self through seven levels of consciousness. Each revolution around the Ka’aba is a journey towards the ultimate truth. It is a meditation, a prayer, a worship in realisation. I read somewhere a description of it as: ‘The planets rotate around the sun, the electrons around the nucleus, the moth around the candle’. Rotating around the source of life (representatively), a centering of oneself in alignment with pure love (worship). READ MORE: Arafat Sermon: Unity A Cause For Salvation, Muslim Ummah urged God Almighty states the following in the Holy Quran: “The seven heavens and the earth, and all beings therein, declare His glory: there not a thing but celebrates His praise; and yet ye understand not how they declare His glory…”. (Al-Isra, 44). Entering Masjid-al-Haraam When I entered Haram Sharif, the mosque complex of the Khaana-e-Ka’aba, a first glance made me think this was like any other large, modern mosque. But as I walked deeper inside the halls, following the crowds towards the central atrium, an area called the Mataf, and the site of the Khaana-e-Ka’aba, the sense of excitement was palpable. If one enters the complex from the King Faisal or King Fahd gates, one can catch a glimpse of the black and gold embroidered Kiswah covering the Ka’aba, framed through a balcony courtyard. Only when one descends to the ground level and looks at it directly, its simplicity strikes you. It beckons to you. It is a magnet. My first response upon coming across this sight, I remember, was to smile. Standing in the centre – or is it a centre, I do not know – it stood there as thousands of souls circumnavigated around it, praying. In movies, you often come across moments when there is noise everywhere and, in your mind (heart), or your reality, there is but one focus – without any noise. That comes closest to describing my Ka’aba experience. The Khaana-e-Ka’aba experience When the Azaan is sounded, the energy pivots in the entire complex. The stillness at this moment is sublime. If you are fortunate enough to be able to say your prayers in the Mataf area, it is an experience you simply cannot forget. Everyone stands in a circle, contrary to the lines one sees at regular prayer congregations. This is the only place on Earth where this is done. READ MORE: Thinking Of The Desperate Mother You do not have to look down on your prayer mat, imagining that you are standing before the Ka’aba, it is right there in front of you. It is present during your Takbir (standing), Ruku (bowing), Sajda and Tashahhud (sitting). Here, you do not have to imagine – you can just look up and feel. The first time I prayed at the Ka’aba, I was so overwhelmed that it is impossible to describe. Cube of divinity The cube structure has been built and rebuilt several times over centuries. The last major renovation took place in 1996. Muslims believe that it was first built by Hazrat Adam (AS). Then it was rebuilt by Hazrat Ibrahim (AS) and later Prophet Mohammad (PBUH). Lots of change without essentially altering. Or altering completely without changing. In the past 1,400 years, the Ka’aba has been renovated and rebuilt due to man-made and natural disasters. In 683 AD, the Umayyads tried to seize the Ka’aba. In the fires caused by the siege, the Ka’aba was damaged. But during its reconstruction, a space – which was once inside the Ka’aba – was left. This area is now called the Hateem. I was fortunate enough to pray there and say my peace with our Creator a couple of times. In 1631 AD, after floods ravaged the city, the Ka’aba and the surrounding mosque had to be rebuilt entirely. I had not realised how often the Ka’aba had to be rebuilt, changing and transforming it with each rebuild. It is something to think about. Lots of change without essentially altering. Or altering completely without changing. The four corners of the Ka’aba roughly point along four directions; the Black Stone (Hajar-e-Aswad) is placed on the Eastern corner; the Northern wall is called Iraqi, the Western the Levantine, and the Southern corner is Yemeni. The rock from God? Every pilgrim who makes it to the Khaana-e-Ka’aba desires to touch, kiss and be near Hajar-e-Aswad (Blackstone). The story of this supposed meteorite, inset in the eastern corner of the Ka’aba’s wall, is fascinating. Tradition says that five years before Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) was ordained with Prophethood, he helped broker peace among the local warring tribes in Makkah. To resolve the dispute, he removed a sheet of cloth and placed the Hajar-e-Aswad on the fabric. Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) then asked each tribe’s leader to grab hold of a corner of the fabric, walked them to the eastern corner of the Ka’aba’s wall, and asked them to place it. This is how the meteorite was placed in the corner of the Ka’aba, a symbol of unity amongst differing warring tribes, a symbol of peace. This story makes sense because the pagan dwellers of pre-Islamic Makkah worshipped many deities inside the Ka’aba. Home to so many pre-Islamic deities, common ground was needed to appease all the tribes. Prophet Mohammad (PBUH), heralded as a conflict-remover and peace-maker, would have certainly adopted such a placating strategy to achieve peace. It is also symbolic he placed it outside of the Ka’aba rather than inside. The Hajar-e-Aswad was broken into eight pieces during the siege by the Umayyads in 683 AD. A catapult had smashed into it, leaving it broken. Later, Abdullah bin Zubair rejoined the black stone, piece by piece, using silver ligament in a process closer to the Japanese art of Kintsugi, where gold is used instead of silver to effect the repair. Even more incredible, in 930 AD, the Hajar-e-Aswad was stolen by the Qarmatians, a Muslim sect from eastern Arabia. They looted Makkah and took the sacred stone to Ihsaa. It would be another 22 years before the Abbasids retrieved the Hajar-e-Aswad and returned it to its designated place in 952 AD. This story and proximity helped satiate my curiosity about how the Hajar-e-Aswad got to that particular corner of the Ka’aba! Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is known to have loved scents. The Hajar-e-Aswad and the black and gold drape over the Khaana-e-Ka’aba are perfumed with a scented oil – – Attar — called Haajr-e-Aswad. I am not a fan of Attar, but this combination of oils and musk was heavenly. Muslims believe the Hajar-e-Aswad (Blackstone) is a piece from ‘heaven’ and is part and parcel of the Khaana-e-Ka’aba. It is believed that it was originally white in colour, but after absorbing the sins of humanity, its shade has transformed. In reality, though, the colour of the Hajar-e-Aswad is amber and is a series of eight (meteorite) stones combined in a mesh to appear as one stone. It is now also encased in a silver peek hole that juts out of the eastern corner of the Ka’aba. It is also where we begin our Tawaaf for Umrah. Connecting with our past The Khaana-e-Ka’aba has many wonderment parts and symbols that connect us to our past. One of these is Maqaam-e-Ibrahim. It is known as the place where Prophet Ibrahim (AS) stood as he rebuilt the holy building. During my Umrah in March and then later during the Umrah just before the Haj, I had the fortune of touching the monument of Ibrahim (AS) during every Tawaaf. Clearly, there is some message here and blessings from the CreatorCreator. One can see the outline of a footprint, believed to belong to Prophet Ibrahim (AS), is visible on a small, red stone. This stone is encased in a tall, long gold case, which stands in front of the Ka’aba on the western side. Pilgrims pass it, behind or in front of it, during every Tawaaf. As we pass it, we pay respect and offer a prayer. The Holy Quran refers to this footprint as Maqaam-e-Ibrahim, in Surah Al-Baqarh verse 125: “When We made the House (Ka’bah of Makkah) a frequented place for men and a place of peace! Make from the Station of Ibrāhīm a place of prayer.” There is much history in every inch of the Mataaf (the area around the Khaana-e-Ka’aba). The western courtyard of the Ka’aba is called the Hijr-e-Ismail, where Bibi Hajra’s home once stood (with Ibrahim (AS) and Ismail (AS)). From here, Ibrahim built the Khana-e-Ka’aba. I am reiterating these well-known facts of the pilgrimage of Haj because they are so innately associated with Bibi Hajra, a woman of substance. Makkah became a thriving trading route once Aab-e-Zam Zam was discovered. As the traditions state, Bibi Hajra (AS) (the wife of Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and mother of Prophet Ismail (AS)) is responsible for the discovery of the holiest of water. In her anxiety to find water for her baby, she ran from one hill, Saafa, to another, Marwa. She repeated this frantic journey seven times before baby Ismail’s (AS) heel indicated to her the location from whence the Zam Zam spring sprouted water. Ever since, the city of Makkah has thrived and sustained a community. But she did not monopolise this precious resource. Instead, she allowed anyone who needed it to have free access. Then, her husband, Prophet Ibrahim (AS), was instructed to rebuild the Khaana-e-Ka’aba- once again. Religious historians tell us that Adam (AS) built the first Khaana-e-Ka’aba when he walked the Earth. Ibrahim (AS) was instructed to rebuild it. This is article is the first in a series of diaries penned by the author from her Haj experience. Subsequent parts will be included below.",

      "title": "‘Ruzzki not welcome’: the Russian exiles getting a hostile reception in Georgia",
      "text": "Dima Belysh stood in the empty park amphitheatre in his orange hoodie and dirty white sneakers. It was November in Tbilisi, Georgia, and he was in the middle of a 24-hour performance art piece dedicated to his hasty flight to the Georgian capital from his home in St Petersburg, Russia. When I showed up I was the only spectator, so he had plenty of time to talk. “It’s ironic,” Belysh told me. “I went from a place I didn’t feel at home to a place that is not welcoming me.” He had been openly against the war in Ukraine, but his prospects outside Russia – he didn’t have much money and doesn’t speak any language other than Russian – were meagre. So at first, after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, he stayed. But when the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, announced a general mobilisation at the end of September, Belysh, as a man of draft age, had no choice but to leave the country or risk being conscripted into an army he did not support, to fight a war he found unjust. Georgia was a logical destination: it was one of the few countries with a border that remained open to Russians unable to afford plane tickets. But tens of thousands of Russians had the same idea, and border guards in the small town in the Caucasus mountains that hosts Georgia’s only land crossing with Russia were overwhelmed. Belysh’s performance was his small way of reckoning with his experience of leaving Russia. But his timing was awkward: he had scheduled it for a day when Russia had just embarked on a vicious new phase of its campaign, targeting Ukrainian civilian infrastructure in order to deprive the population of electricity and heating. Belysh had tried to promote the event on social media ahead of time, but his post drew a barrage of negative comments, particularly from Georgians and Ukrainians whose tolerance for Russian anything, much less self-pity, was worn down to zero. “This is not Putin’s war. This is Russia’s war,” one commenter wrote in response to Belysh’s announcement. Belysh is part of a massive influx of Russian emigrants who have settled in Georgia – mostly in Tbilisi, a city of 1.2 million people – since the start of the war. While the statistics are imprecise, government figures indicate that, as of October 2022, more than 110,000 Russians had arrived in Georgia since the start of the war. (The same report found that more than 25,000 Ukrainians had also relocated there since the start of the invasion.) The influx has overwhelmed the city, taxing its housing and social infrastructure, and exacerbating existing political and cultural rifts. Intrinsic to Georgia’s post-Soviet national identity is its centuries-long domination by Russia, dating from the late-18th and early-19th centuries, when Georgian kings requested Russian protection as a security guarantee against attacks from the Persian Empire to the south. The Russians not only failed to prevent Persian aggression – Tbilisi was levelled during an invasion in 1795 – but annexed Georgia outright in 1801 and made it part of their empire. Thus began two centuries of rule from the north, which ended only in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Georgians have long insisted that their grievance is only with the Russian state, not with the Russian people. But the invasion of Ukraine has all but eroded that distinction. The flight of tens of thousands of Russians who consider themselves victims of their own government comes just as Georgians are more inclined than ever to place collective responsibility for the war in Ukraine upon all Russians. The mass migration has roiled Georgia and confronted it with knotty moral questions: who counts as a victim? What responsibility do citizens hold for the actions of their nations? How should we allocate our sympathy? After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, graffiti quickly began popping up around Tbilisi, in particular in its attractive historic centre. “FUCK RUSSIA” and “FUCK PUTIN”, many of them read (in English), or “Russian warship, go fuck yourself” – a reference to the famous words of a Ukrainian soldier on Snake Island in the Black Sea before he was taken captive by Russian forces in February 2022. The graffiti was sprayed on Tbilisi’s picturesquely crumbling plaster walls, beneath ornate 19th-century balconies, on plywood fences blocking off new construction projects, in the gentrifying neighbourhood of Mtatsminda and other central Tbilisi districts. These areas have long attracted foreigners, including hundreds of thousands of tourists, and a good number of expats from around the world – I am American and have lived in Mtatsminda for three years. Tbilisi had already seen a surge of Russian immigration in 2021, after the Kremlin significantly tightened the screws on independent organisations and media, forcing many activists and journalists to flee abroad. But that boom was far eclipsed in 2022, when it soon became more common to hear Russian spoken in my neighbourhood than Georgian. The invasion of Ukraine evoked a complex set of emotions for Georgians: sympathy for Ukrainians and fear that Russia might soon turn its gaze back to Georgia, which it had previously invaded in 2008. If Russia won in Ukraine, Georgians had reason to fear that the Kremlin would be emboldened to come and finish the job it began in 2008. If it lost, they also feared that small and weak Georgia could be an easy consolation prize. There was also hate. Even before the graffiti started to pop up, there was writing on virtual walls, outpourings of vitriol on social media. Concerned citizens circulated a petition to institute a visa regime for Russians. Otherwise sensible people argued that the Russians fleeing to Tbilisi posed a threat, suggesting that Putin might use their presence in Georgia as a pretext to “liberate” them. Some said the Russians should have remained at home and tried to overthrow Putin, and that they were to blame for not having done so before the war. Still others suggested that the Tbilisi Russians were merely pretending to be against the war in Ukraine, and that despite their attestations to the contrary, the rot of Russian colonialism was so deep that even self-proclaimed dissidents could not wash off its stench. A friend told me about a fistfight at a bar between a Russian and a Georgian. A Telegram channel for Russians in Tbilisi posted an anonymous recording of someone (speaking in Georgian-accented Russian) threatening to beat up Russians. Given that the Kremlin considers Russophobia in Ukraine to be a justification for war there, the situation here in Tbilisi felt pregnant with tension. One twentysomething Russian human rights activist who came after the 2021 crackdown initially settled in happily. (She insisted on anonymity out of concerns for the safety of her family in Russia.) “But when the war started, things changed radically,” she told me. “Georgians became hostile to Russians overnight. Before the war I would never think people would be hostile.” She took a trip to the Black Sea coast and tried to book a place to stay online, but several would-be hosts refused to rent to her because she was Russian. One wrote that she should instead “go back to Russia and fight Putin”. (The message was in Georgian; she used Google Translate.) She tried to explain that she could not return to Russia. “I was so angry. I told him: ‘I am a human rights activist, I am a journalist, I have friends who were tortured,’” she said. He asked her to send documents proving she was persecuted, and only then, she recalled, did he say that “maybe we will let you stay”. The Russian arrivals settled into self-contained émigré quarters, and in the absence of regular communication between Georgians and Russians, graffiti seemed to fill the vacuum. It became ubiquitous around Tbilisi’s central districts; you couldn’t walk 50 metres without seeing “Ruzzia is a terrorist state”. Over time, it seemed to become less about Russia the state and more about Russians as people: “Ruzzki go home” and “Ruzzki not welcome”. (The “z” referred to the Russian state’s symbol for the war.) “Fuck off home” in Russian. “Russians go back to ur ugly country.” While Russia has dominated Georgia for two centuries, the current Georgian grievance against Russia centres on the two territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both home to eponymous ethnic minorities. Both broke away from Georgia in separatist wars in the 1990s; hundreds of thousands of ethnic Georgians had to flee the territories. Their self-proclaimed governments are now propped up by Russia, which has military bases in each. Now a popular talking point is that Russia thus “occupies” 20% of Georgia. (Some of the new graffiti reads: “Occupants go home.”) Georgia’s attempt to retake control of South Ossetia led to the 2008 war, in which Russia not only pushed Georgian forces out of South Ossetia but briefly advanced well inside Georgia proper, with significant attacks reaching the central city of Gori, and Poti in the far west. According to official figures from each side, 228 Georgian and 162 South Ossetian civilians were killed. For many Georgians, the 2008 war and Russia’s presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia are just the latest chapters in a centuries-old story of Russia thwarting Georgia’s national ambitions. (That war took place just months after Nato promised that it would eventually accept Georgia as a member.) They see Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a similar attack upon people they now consider kin. One liberal magazine has started a campaign to recognise the ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia as a “genocide”, the campaign is called Before Bucha there was Abkhazia. In my conversations with Russians here in Tbilisi, I have found them aware only of the vague outlines of what happened in Abkhazia and South Ossetia; the wars in Georgia are a blip in the story that Russians, whether pro- or anti-government, know about their country. But even if Russian émigrés don’t engage much with Georgian domestic politics, domestic politics engages with them. Georgia’s ruling party seems to be trying to engage in a balancing act. Its actions are geared toward maintaining the country’s pro-western orientation: enforcing international sanctions against Russia, voting with the west on UN resolutions, applying for EU membership. Yet the words of its senior officials tell a different story. Lately, they have studiously avoided criticising Russia, and have been far more critical of the Ukrainian government, even dabbling in anti-western conspiracy theories. These statements have enraged many Georgians who want the government to take a stronger stand in support of Ukraine; opposition parties and other critics accuse the government of kowtowing to Moscow. So far, the government’s tightrope act has, for the most part, worked. It has garnered praise from western capitals for adhering to the sanctions, and from Moscow for not doing much more. But this state of affairs is becoming increasingly unsustainable. In mid-May, after barely acknowledging Georgia’s existence since the beginning of the war, Putin dropped a bombshell: Russia would reverse a ban on direct flights to Georgia it instituted in 2019, and also remove visa restrictions for Georgians travelling to Russia. This development would have been welcomed in Georgia before the Russia-Ukraine war, but now it appeared to be a poisoned chalice, seemingly calculated to drive a wedge between the Georgian government and its allies in the west. And it worked: The US and the EU warned that allowing Russian airlines to fly to Georgia risked exposing Georgian companies to sanctions. Georgia went ahead with it anyway, citing the economic benefits of the travel resumption, a move that has drawn harsh criticism from Washington and Brussels. The émigrés are caught up in this squabbling. The ruling party has sought to downplay the issue by emphasising that many of the new arrivals are in fact ethnic Georgians, and that a lot of them are using Georgia only as a transit point en route to other destinations. There are regular controversies about Russian opposition-linked figures who are not let in to Georgia: critical journalists, a lawyer for opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and a member of the activist group Pussy Riot are among those who have reportedly been denied entry since the war began. To the opposition in Georgia, these actions are proof that the Georgian government is doing the Kremlin’s bidding. It’s a murky topic, though: many Russians I spoke with do believe that the government may be blocking some people in order to prevent Tbilisi from becoming a hub of Russian opposition activity and attracting Moscow’s ire; but at the same time, the number of Russian oppositionists who have been blocked is dwarfed by those who have been let in. Several opposition groups of exiled Russian journalists and activists have had no trouble setting up shop here. A few months after the full-scale invasion began, I noticed that some of my neighbours had printed and hung a sign on their balcony, reading (in Russian): “It is not the time to enjoy yourself when at this very moment RUSSIANS are killing and torturing CHILDREN in Ukraine! If you ‘fled’ from Russia, PROTEST OR MOURN AT HOME!” It can be tempting to overinterpret the graffiti. But as I started to meet and interview Russians about their exodus, they frequently brought it up. The street markings were a significant part of their experience, a visual bullhorn constantly announcing what (at least some vocal portion of) Georgians thought about them. “It works,” one Russian academic who moved here a few months after the start of the war told me. The graffiti was a reminder to stay quiet. He had been attacked on social media for suggesting that dissident Russians didn’t deserve collective punishment for the war. He deleted his Twitter account and asked not to be named in this story. “Being on the streets, especially the first time I came to Tbilisi, it felt as if I was inside the Twitter feed,” he said. “It was a metaverse-like experience – only you can’t really unfollow it.” Belysh, the performance artist, told me he believed it wasn’t Georgians writing much of the Russophobic graffiti, but Russians themselves. This belief – repeated by many other Russians in Tbilisi – originated with a social media post that went viral in the fall. A Russian man had filmed himself spray-painting “Fuck Russians :)” on a Tbilisi wall. I was sceptical, so I tracked down the graffitist from the video, Andrei Mitroshin, a punk musician who had fled Moscow soon after the war started, first to Yerevan in Armenia, and then to Tbilisi. He told me he had posted the video as a comment on a friend’s post “as a joke, and from there someone took it at face value”. He had even posted on Telegram the day after it went viral: “The IRONY is that it was written by a Russian (me) “The POST-IRONY is that it’s possible to imagine that all this graffiti was written by Russians, to intimidate other Russians.” That correction, though, doesn’t seem to have had the same legs as his viral video, which contained a kernel of truthiness that resonated with many Russians here. In his correction post, Mitroshin took pains to emphasise that the graffiti around the city did not represent his typical in-person interactions with Georgians. “Living in Georgia for some time, every day we see on all the walls here are written ‘FUCK RUSSIANS’, ‘RUSSIANS GO HOME’, and so on,” he wrote. “There are of course people here who don’t like Russians (for understandable reasons). And this graffiti often scares many Russians, and many are afraid to come here because of Russophobia that they have heard or read about somewhere.” But he concluded: “Georgia is a wonderful country with wonderful and super friendly people. In the half year I have been here neither I nor any of my friends have encountered any aggression or Russophobia, and if you act normally and don’t support the war, everyone will treat you normally.” Others had little difficulty believing that Georgians were behind the street markings. Alexander, a recent émigré and fellow amateur scholar of anti-Russia graffiti who didn’t want to give his full name, gave me a little tour of his neighbourhood, Vera, not far from mine. He had heard many of his compatriots espouse the theory that the graffiti was written by Russians, and he was marshalling evidence that it wasn’t. On one wall was a variation of a ubiquitous graffito: “Putin is a dickhead.” But this one mixed a Russian “i” and a Ukrainian “kh” in a way no native speaker of either of those languages would have. Nearby was another bit of graffiti, the classic “Russian warship go fuck yourself”. I had already noticed this one; it was missing one “s” in “Russian”. Alexander said that was something even a native speaker could do if in a hurry and careless. What was more telling, he pointed out, was the way some of the Cyrillic letters were written. The Russian “y” bore an unmistakable resemblance to the Georgian “kh”, and the Russian “b” to the Georgian “n”. “It was definitely Georgians who did this,” he said. Georgians didn’t need any convincing that the graffiti was domestically produced either. There have been a few small social media brouhahas on the rare occasions when the city has cleaned up some anti-Russia graffiti; to many liberal Georgians, these cleanup efforts fed the theory that the government was secretly pro-Russia. The graffiti, they felt, was expressing the will of the people. The fact that many Russians did not believe that Georgians were writing the graffiti, though, seemed to speak to a wilful ignorance about how their presence was being received. Many of the Russians I have spoken with have experienced a profound shock about the nature of their country, and many have written it off for ever, virtually overnight. The dominant impulse seems to be to don a collective hair shirt. Many Russian establishments in Tbilisi are identifiable by the Ukrainian flag on display and a poster with a QR code letting you donate to the Ukrainian armed forces. If they bring up some way in which Russian émigrés are poorly treated, it is invariably caveated with: “Of course, it’s nothing compared to what Ukrainians are going through.” “Decolonisation” is a buzzword in the city. During his 24-hour performance piece, Belysh had a lot of time to kill, so he had brought along some reading: a Russian translation of Internal Colonization, a 2011 book by the historian Alexander Etkind that reimagines Russian history through the lens of postcolonial theory. For obvious reasons, it has gained currency and popularity since the start of the war. “Maybe it has some answers for me,” Belysh said. “Russians think we don’t have anything without them, but it’s not true,” Zurab Chitaia told me. He has a complicated identity: with a Georgian father and a Russian mother, he grew up speaking Russian in Abkhazia. Nearly all ethnic Georgians were forced out of Abkhazia during the war in the 90s, and Chitaia’s family fled to Moscow when he was a teenager. He moved to Tbilisi a few years ago and now runs a chain of popular bars here. He said he was generally in favour of the graffiti that had emerged, though he thought the message needed to be sharpened: “Putin isn’t a dickhead, he’s a murderer and a terrorist.” Chitaia hosts a Russian-language podcast about Georgia in which he pushes back against some of the extreme attempts to bully people in Tbilisi out of speaking Russian. But he said that many Russians underestimate Georgians’ antipathy toward them. “Young Georgians are not interested in Russia,” he said. “They are like, ‘Leave us alone, we don’t know you, we never saw anything good from you guys, we don’t like you. We grew up without you and all we know from you is tanks, bombs and killing.’ Our parents and grandparents were forced to be involved and oriented toward Russia. But we’re not.” The fact that Russians can still enter Georgia without doing anything more than showing their passport rankles many Georgians. Russia is only one of 95 countries whose citizens enjoy Georgia’s laissez-faire visa-free policy, but last year’s influx has spurred calls by the opposition to introduce visa requirements for Russians. The government has resisted, however, citing the economic benefit that the émigrés bring: the country’s GDP grew more than 10% in 2022, and government officials have given partial credit to the Russian arrivals. But the economic benefits have been distributed unequally. Landlords, restaurant owners and the like have done well out of the arrival of tens of thousands of middle-class consumers. Working-class Georgians, meanwhile, are suffering from the resulting inflation. After Putin’s mid-May announcement about restoring direct flights between Russia and Georgia, the visa debate flared up again, and this time the US embassy got involved: the ambassador suggested that Putin may intend to “use” the Russian presence to interfere in Georgia somehow. And while a few months earlier she had urged that “Georgia must continue to welcome those fleeing Russian repression”, now she was sympathetically noting that “many Georgians … are concerned about the hundred thousand Russians who came to Georgia last year”. To live in Tbilisi is to be enveloped in layers of responsibility and victimhood, to inhabit a hierarchy of perpetrators, colonisers and colonised. The influx of Russians has, in the view of many activists, complicated Georgian domestic politics and also hampered the nation’s efforts to reckon with its own history of dominating smaller nations. The origins of the wars of the 1990s are hotly contested, but a significant share of the responsibility lies with Georgia, a fact that is obscured by the narrative of “Russian occupation”. The occupation narrative also denies the agency of Abkhazians and Ossetians themselves – for the most part they do not consider themselves occupied, and view Russian backing as a necessary evil protecting them against what they deem the greater danger of Georgian nationalism. In today’s overheated atmosphere, these nuances are increasingly lost. “The Russia-Ukraine war paralysed the process of rethinking our conflicts, making it almost impossible to discover and realise our own mistakes,” wrote Anna Dziapshipa, a Tbilisi-based film-maker of Georgian and Abkhazian background. Meanwhile, the graffiti keeps proliferating and evolving. It’s not uncommon to see some graffiti painted over, messages altered in a kind of public conversation or debate. One common edit is to change “Fuck Russia” to “Fuck Putin”. Near me there is a “RUSSIANS FUCK OFF CUNTS”, and someone added above it: “NATIONALISTS OF ALL COUNTRIES GO FUCK YOURSELVES”. I have been monitoring another one in the neighbourhood that started out as “Russians go home”, written in blue, to which someone edited the last word in yellow (for the colours of the Ukrainian flag) to read: “Russians go help”. Recently, it was changed again. Now it reads: “Russians go to hell”. This piece was originally published in issue No 5 of the Dial.",

Today has been a rare chance for residents and people from across the country to buy some vintage pieces, which may be recognised from some of theatre’s biggest productions, including Don Lockwood’s suit; Lina Lamont’s pink dress from the 2016 production of Singin’ in the Rain, period costumes from Jane Eyre, and costume pieces from the BFG. According to organisers, the event has been a huge success, with queues of people waiting to get in – with one member of the public even travelling all the way from Brighton for a chance to grab a costume. Octagon wardrobe manager, Su Newell, said she is really pleased with the turn out and they are thinking of conducting another sale in the future. She said: “It has been busy today, we had a queue before we opened this morning, quite a few people and had about two or three hundred people through the door so far and took a £1,000 in the first hour. “Items are going, people are buying things that I wasn’t expecting to go which is interesting and a lot of people want to know what shows things are from and so where I know I am telling them. “There has been a lot of, sounds really mad, but a lot of ordinary stuff has been sold, I didn’t think these items would sell more, I was expecting it to be the big ticket, very show related stuff that would go but it hasn’t so far. “People are buying the patchwork and the bunting kits as well so they can do their own making and people are trying stuff on so yes it has been good, and it has been busy, and people are coming in consistently. Outfits on sale at The Octagon (Image: NQ) “We sold Cinderella, but so far, we haven’t persuaded anyone to buy the Singing in the Rain suit, but we will see. “There has been a lot of interest in the Jayne Eyre items though. “I think possibly we will do this again in the future, maybe next year or in a couple of years because we are always creating more costumes, so we always need to make more space. “Some of these items have probably been in our wardrobe store for 50 or so years so it was time for a clear-out.

The producing-house theatre make and source all their own costumes for their in-house productions, with more than 16,000 garments of clothing in their costume store. One family travelled from Levenshulme in Manchester, to take a look at the items on sale. John Soffe and partner Laura alongside their children Sam and Ivy decided to have a look around the sale in the hopes to find some great outfits and pieces for ImproQuo, a Manchester based comedy and theatre company. Some of the outfits still on sale (Image: NQ) Speaking about the sale, John said: “At ImproQuo, we do shows called Drunk Classics which is improved versions of old novels, so we have done Pride and Prejudice and Wuthering Heights, we have just finished doing Jurassic Park, so it’s an improv group. “And because there is a lot of quick change, we have picked up some costumes such as Victorian outfits and a couple of wigs and other bits and pieces, there has been quite a lot of good stuff on offer. “We got here late so expected there to be less left but there is still plenty.” Emily Buckley also attended the sale today, travelling from Pendleton College in Salford, said it is great to have an event like this in the north. Speaking about what she bought, Emily said: “I work as a costume lady at Pendleton College in Salford so I’ve come to see if there are any bits and bobs that would be useful for us, for the next year.

      "title": "Creating Cohesion: The Art of Professional Document Assembly",
      "text": "Imagine assembling a jigsaw puzzle. Each piece has its place, and when those pieces come together, they create a coherent image. Similarly, when we talk about professional documents, each section or part serves as a piece of that puzzle. The art of document assembly is ensuring that each ‘piece’ fits seamlessly to convey the desired message or information effectively. Let’s delve deeper into mastering this art and ensuring your documents stand out in the corporate realm. The Foundations of Document Assembly Before you start arranging the components of your document, it’s vital to understand its purpose and audience. Are you aiming to inform, persuade, or educate? Knowing this can guide the tone and structure of your content. Moreover, tools and resources can significantly influence the document assembly process. While digital tools like word processors, PDF editors, and cloud-based platforms can facilitate organization and layout, there are times when physical documents take center stage. In such cases, something as simple as a binding machine can be invaluable in binding pages together, ensuring a sleek finish and easy navigation. Segmenting the Information Introduction or Overview: Like the entrance to a grand building, your document’s introduction sets the tone. It should briefly explain what the document covers and why it matters. Body of Content: This is where you dive deep. The body holds the bulk of the information, arguments, data, or narratives. Organize the content in a logical order, ensuring a smooth flow of ideas. Visual Elements: Graphs, tables, diagrams, and illustrations can significantly enhance the readability of your document. They break text-heavy sections and can often convey complex data more succinctly than words alone. Conclusion or Summary: Round off your document by revisiting the main points. This section reinforces your message and offers a quick recap for the reader. Appendices and References: These come at the end and contain supplementary information that supports your main content. Make sure to cite sources and provide additional data or details that are relevant but not central to the main text. Styling and Formatting: Consistency is Key Font Choices: Stick to a maximum of two or three fonts. Use them consistently – one for headers, one for body text, and perhaps another for captions or special highlights. Spacing and Margins: Adequate space makes a document breathable. Uniform margins and consistent spacing between lines and sections enhance readability and create a harmonious look. Headers and Footers: These can contain page numbers, document titles, or dates. They assist in navigation, especially in lengthy documents. Color Palette: If using color, opt for a scheme that aligns with the document’s theme or the corporate brand. However, ensure that colors don’t overshadow the content or make it difficult to read. Digital Assembly vs. Physical Assembly In today’s digital age, many documents remain electronic. However, physical documents haven’t lost their charm or importance. Here’s a quick guide to both: Digital Assembly: Use hyperlinks for easy navigation. Include interactive elements if suitable, like clickable charts or embedded videos. Ensure compatibility across devices. PDFs are typically a universal choice. Physical Assembly: Use high-quality paper if the document is for an official or formal purpose. Consider the binding – spiral, comb, or thermal? Remember, the binding method can influence the document’s durability and presentation. Use tabs or dividers for extensive documents to facilitate easy navigation. Proofreading: The Final Polish Your document might be well-assembled, but minor errors can detract from its professionalism. Always: Run a spell-check. Proofread for grammar, punctuation, and syntax. Ensure that visuals align with their explanations or legends. Verify all hyperlinks (for digital documents) or references. Cohesion Creates Clarity The art of document assembly lies in creating a sense of unity and cohesion. When every piece fits in its rightful place, the result is a clear, comprehensible, and professional document that meets its objectives and resonates with its audience. Whether you’re using a binding machine for physical documents or a digital platform for electronic ones, the principles of organization, consistency, and clarity remain paramount.

      "title": "Pac-12 survival: The downside risks, potential benefits and missing pieces within an Apple deal",
      "text": "Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff presented a media rights contract to the schools on Tuesday, with nothing less than the future of the century-old conference at stake. Details are sparse as the presidents and athletic directors digest the proposal, save for an ESPN report indicating Kliavkoff’s plan featured a heavy presence on Apple and a revenue structure that tied cash to subscriptions. Our reaction … 1. Any chance to link arms with the richest, most influential, most innovative, savviest, smartest company in the world is something the Pac-12 should seriously consider, especially when that company is rapidly expanding its portfolio of sports properties and positioned to dominate the sports media landscape in the near future. But in this case, the details mean everything. 2. The lean into streaming comes as no surprise. Kliavkoff signaled his strategy 18 months ago, telling a sports media podcast: “Whatever deal we do, it’s my goal to have our content available on any piece of glass connected to the internet. Period, full stop.” Six months later, at a Pac-12 football media event prior to the 2022 season, he indicated the conference’s next media rights deal was “highly likely” to feature a major digital media company. Since that moment, we have presumed Apple or Amazon would have a significant role in the contract. 3. At the same time, the Hotline viewed any media rights deal that didn’t include a package of games on ESPN as a suboptimal approach. ESPN is vital because of the product visibility provided by linear television and the network’s messaging power within the college sports space. If the Pac-12 isn’t contractually tied to ESPN, then its highly-influential studio shows have little motivation to discuss the conference and promote its teams and players. 4. Which brings us to a critical point in this assessment: The unknown elements of the deal Kliavkoff presented. Is the proposed contract only with Apple? Or is there a separate linear TV component? Did Apple commit to sub-licensing games on ESPN or another network? What other deals are under consideration, if any? 5. Within the Apple piece alone, there are myriad unknowns. How much revenue is guaranteed per year? How easily reached are any subscription-based incentives? How would Pac-12 content be viewed on Apple products and, of course, what’s the cost? Lacking details, we’ll presume the proposal loosely mirrors Major League Soccer’s new distribution deal with Apple: The MLS Season Pass was made available for $99 annually through the Apple TV app on iPhones, iPads, Macs, smart TVs, etc. (Existing subscribers received a discount.) 6. Another question: To what extent will Apple throw its immense marketing power behind the Pac-12? “They have ways to engage people beyond what the other outlets do,” said a media industry source familiar with Apple’s work with the MLS. But is Apple fully committed to helping the Pac-12 thrive? What are the contractual stipulations in that regard? 7. How would the football schedule work, particularly the kickoff times? Traditional broadcast windows do not exist on streaming platforms. Would there be a weekly selection process, or could the Pac-12 set the start times weeks (and perhaps months) in advance? Would there be a need for Thursday or Friday games? Could each team play every home game at 1 p.m. or 4 p.m. if so desired? 8. How would an Apple deal impact recruiting? Yes, the prospects want to perform on the sport’s biggest stages — that’s one reason the Hotline has always viewed ESPN as a critical piece to any contract. That said, recruiting is increasingly driven by NIL opportunities, which aren’t connected to ESPN, and the transfer portal, where prospects seeking a second chance prioritize playing time and skill development. Also, every high school recruit spends hours per day staring at his iPhone. Which brings us back to the aforementioned question: To what extent will Apple throw its immense marketing power behind the Pac-12? 9. The conference plans to expand — it needs a 10th team in time for the 2024 football season. Will the targets change with a media contract that connects revenue to streaming subscriptions? If the size of the fan base matters more than the size of the media market, perhaps San Diego State (undergraduate enrollment: approximately 31,000) is more advantageous than SMU (7,000). Perhaps the conference would reconsider the merits of large schools with passionate followings, like Fresno State and Boise State, that have not been on the expansion radar. Add this item to the lengthy list of unknowns. 10. Kliavkoff’s strategy also focused on limiting the duration of the contract. Specifically, he wanted a deal that expired before the new Big Ten (2030) and Big 12 (2031) contracts, thus giving the Pac-12 a chance to gorge at the media cash trough before its competition. Within that approach is a vital calculation for the university presidents to consider: The next contract. Yep, the schools are already (and smartly) thinking about what comes next. How would a contract cycle that begins in the summer of 2024 position the Pac-12 for a deal that starts in the summer of 2029? This topic carries the most intrigue but is also the most difficult for us to parse, because we don’t know how the sports media landscape will look in five or six years. But we know cord-cutting is real and that media companies are increasingly moving their sports inventory to streaming. We know ESPN will become available on a direct-to-consumer basis in a few years, the company is seeking a strategic partner and Apple is a prime candidate for that role. What might that mean for the Pac-12 in Year One of an agreement with Apple, and what would it mean for Years Three and Five? Should the Pac-12 prioritize a close relationship with Apple above all else, including revenue? Is the best comparison not the MLS Season Pass on Apple TV+ but, rather, the Big East’s marriage to ESPN in the early 1980s, when the network was on the verge of domination? We cannot offer answers, but those are strategic issues the Pac-12 schools should consider. Ultimately, there are too many unknowns — from the linear piece to the subscription incentives to the marketing plan — for the Hotline to render final judgment. This much is clear: The future of the conference is at stake. Colorado just left for the Big 12, and Arizona could very well be next. That might force Arizona State to leave, sparking the swift extinction of the Pac-12 as we know it. Is the Apple deal good enough to save it? The devil’s in the details. *** Send suggestions, comments and tips (confidentiality guaranteed) to pac12hotline@bayareanewsgroup.com or call 408-920-5716 *** Follow me on Twitter: @WilnerHotline *** Pac-12 Hotline is not endorsed or sponsored by the Pac-12 Conference, and the views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the views of the Conference.",
